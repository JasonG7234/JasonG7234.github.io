	<div id="about" class="right"><h2>In case you don't know by now, my name is Jason Gomes.</h2>
	<p>I am a 21 year old student at Rutgers University. I major in Computer Science along with Information Technology & Informatics. 
	I have worked as a HRIS Intern at L'Oreal as well as a Test Enginer Intern for iCims. If you want a clearer picture as to what that entails, 
	you can check out the <a href="work.html">work section</a>. 
	I grew up in Old Bridge, NJ. My dad is a high school basketball scout, and through him my love of basketball was born. 
	I can't begin to talk about the number of games we've watched together, from small high school games to NBA playoff games. 
	As I grew up, I was always the tech guru of our house. I got used to fixing everything from the toaster oven to diagnosing Microsoft errors and installing RAM.
	When I got to college, I narrowed my potential career options down to computers and sports, specifically basketball. I took a few intro to CS classes and loved it, along with being a manager for the Rutgers Men's Basketball team for two years. 
	I eventually realized that there's so much that can be done in that intersection between basketball and data. I'm currently in the process of making both a draft evaluation model, along with creating a web scraper in Python that returns any college basketball player's specified information.</div>
