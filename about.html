	<h2 style="display: inline; font-size: 32px; color: white;">In case you don't know by now, my name is Jason Gomes.</h2><br>
	<span id="about" class="text">I am a 21 year old senior at Rutgers University majoring in both Computer Science and Information Technology & Informatics. 
	I have worked as a HRIS Intern at L'Oreal as well as a Test Enginer Intern for iCims. If you want a clearer picture as to what that entails, 
	you can check out the <a style="color: #e80109" href="work.html">work section</a>. <br>
	I grew up in Old Bridge, NJ. My dad is a high school basketball scout, and through him my love of basketball was born. 
	I can't begin to talk about the number of games we've watched together, from small high school games to NBA playoff games. 
	As I grew up, I was always the tech guru of our house. I got used to fixing everything from the toaster oven to diagnosing Microsoft errors and installing RAM.<br>
	When I got to college, I narrowed my potential career options down to computers and sports, specifically basketball. I took a few intro to CS classes and loved it, along with being a manager for the Rutgers Men's Basketball team for two years. <br>
	<h2 style="display: inline; color: white;">I eventually realized that there's so much that can be done in that intersection between basketball and data.</h2><br> I'm currently in the process of making both a draft evaluation model, along with creating a web scraper in Python that returns any college basketball player's specified information.</span></div></div>
