<span id="big_board" class="tier_text">Tier 1 - relatively good chance @ All-NBA impact</span>
<br><br>
<span id="big_board" class="player_name">1. Markelle Fultz, Washington - </span><br>High floor, <span id="big_board" class="comp">DeAngelo Russell</span>-esque, big time shot maker. Great scorer on pick and rolls, which will be his main strength in the NBA. Shot above 50% from 2 on 12.5 shot attempts per game, and 41% from 3 on five attempts per game. Free throw percentage is lower than it should be (65%) but will improve. Underrated passer, will be a full time point guard (high assists per 100 possessions) when playing with above average teammates in the NBA. Doesn’t turn the ball over often. Defensively, I’d be shocked if he is anything above a +1 guy, even with his size. Maybe that was just due to a lack of effort on a shitty team, has decent tools. Overall, as a prospect, checks all the boxes you could want. High floor, high ceiling. 
<br><br>
<hr id="big_board" class="tier_break">
<br>
<span id="big_board" class="tier_text">Tier 2 - relatively good chance @ All-Star impact</span>
<br><br>
<span id="big_board" class="player_name">2. Lonzo Ball, UCLA - </span><br>One of the most NBA ready guys I’ve seen, makes big plays, deep range makes up for low shot form, gifted passer, no doubt will learn to be at least average defender considering size and BBIQ. Cannot think of a pure NBA comparison, maybe prime <span id="big_board" class="comp">Shaun Livingston</span> (hate those <span id="big_board" class="comp">Jason Kidd</span> ones). The main worry I have for him is his ability to be a shot creator for himself in the pick and roll or iso. With his release, slow shot and no in-between game, he’ll struggle in that aspect. This is why he truly might be best as an off guard in the half-court considering he can’t create for himself and has no iso scoring ability. 
<br><br>
<span id="big_board" class="player_name">3. Jayson Tatum, Duke - </span><br>Also one of the most NBA ready guys I’ve seen, tremendous shot maker and taker, reminds me of prime <span id="big_board" class="comp">Danny Granger</span> (s/o Johnathan Tjarks). Always in the gym getting better, love that. Defense will always be spotty but will be able to more than make up for it offensively, will be a ball-stopper but not to a Carmelo-like degree. Better athlete than given credit for, will be an above average athlete in the NBA. Shot 50% from 2 on 8 and a half shot attempts per game there, with a free throw rate of 38%. He shot 85% from the line, there is no doubt his three point shot (34%) will improve given time. The only worry is who he’s guarding on defense, if it’s a 3 or a 4. Unsure if he will ever be able to guard either effectively. Might be a liability in situations in the playoffs because of it. <b>Update 5/24 - </b>Moved him up a few spots after seeing some more shooting numbers on him. Synergy has his off the dribble mid-range jumper percentage as being 37%, which does not bode well considering that shot was supposedly his bread and butter. Alternatively, I just watched a video of him nailing 18 straight 3’s from NBA range. So who really knows, scouting is a crapshoot.
<br><br>
<span id="big_board" class="player_name">4. Josh Jackson, Kansas - </span><br>Slightly more polished <span id="big_board" class="comp">Andrew Wiggins</span> with similar ceiling/floor. Slightly better 3 pt shooter but otherwise worse offensive player. Might be less long as well. Better pure instincts as a player and shot blocker especially. My favorite quality in him though is his passing, which could be so vital to his improvement as an NBA player. Not as great of a defender as he’s made out to be, prone to lapses and blow-bys, but effort is usually there and potential definitely is. No doubt can be an <span id="big_board" class="comp">Andre Iguodala</span>-esque player for great team.

<br>
<span id="big_board" class="tier_text">Tier 3 - relatively good chance @ high-end starter impact with moderate chance @ All-Star impact</span>
<br><br>
<span id="big_board" class="player_name">5. Dennis Smith Jr., NC State - </span><br>Exceptional athlete. Underachieved in college. Russell Westbrook-esque energy, although not that caliber. Got to the rim at will in college (had a higher FTr than De’Aaron Fox at 47%). Has shown flashes of a complete game but very rarely. Better jumper than given credit for, shot 41% on NBA range 3’s in college on 37 shots. Can be great defender (as evidenced by good steal and block rates), although I doubt it. Has some <span id="big_board" class="comp">Baron Davis</span> to him. Has HUGE range for his ceiling/floor. Question becomes if he puts it all together. I think he can. 
<br><br>
<span id="big_board" class="player_name">6. Malik Monk, Kentucky - </span><br>One of the best college scorers in recent memory. Incredible shooter, although rarely off screens which is most important part of NBA game. Can shoot with a hand in his face from 35+ feet out. Better finisher than given credit for, not one-dimensional offensively.  Shooting is the second most translatable skill from college to the pros (behind rebounding), so I think he has a high floor at the next level. Defensively at the next level is a different story. Would have to guard 1s bc of slight frame, which means many teams would be at a disadvantage if they do not have perfect defensive situations to hide him. Can turn into a decent defender but will never be great. Best comparisons I can think of are <span id="big_board" class="comp">Lou Williams, Kevin Martin</span>, and (my favorite) <span id="big_board" class="comp">Eric Gordon</span>. 
<br><br>
<span id="big_board" class="player_name">7. Jonathan Isaac, Florida State -  </span><br>
Great potential. Shooting will translate to the next level, as he had a high free throw rate (47%) along with a good percentage (78%). Only shot 35% from three but given time will be a respectable shooter at the NBA level. Has great size and length, will fit in right away athletically. NBA floor is <span id="big_board" class="comp">Jeff Green</span>, with a little more defensive potential. Has all the tools to become a lock-down defender considering his size, length, and atheticism, although I would doubt he ever is more than a +1 or +2 guy on that end. He can be great but something about him just screams apathetic. I never felt as if he could dominate or impose his will on the game, like any of the top 7 guys do. He fits well in the modern NBA but I think the top 7 guys are just better prospects than Isaac. 
<br><br>
<span id="big_board" class="player_name">8. De’Aaron Fox, Kentucky - </span><br>Used to think he was <span id="big_board" class="comp">Elfrid Payton</span>, now I think he’s <span id="big_board" class="comp">Tony Parker</span>. Incredibly quick and fast. Might be able to beat a defender going under a pick just because he’s quick enough to. Has an absolutely terrific floater. In-between game is great, mid-range jumper is there, just can’t shoot from three. Good size, just a little small but will bulk up. Good defender, will be a +1 or +2 guy defensively in his prime. Willing competitor, which is a quality I love to see because that means he will try his ass off when he’s on the court and be in the gym getting better constantly. If he can learn to shoot he might be better than Fultz/Lonzo.
<br><br>
<span id="big_board" class="player_name">9. Donovan Mitchell, Louisville - </span><br>Insane upside as a two-way player. 6’3 combo guard (natural 2) who might be able to develop as a point with some pick and roll upside (http://www.sportschannel8.com/top-8-nba-acc-prospects-part-2/) . Long as hell with a 6’10 wingspan plus 40.5 inch vertical leap. Shows promise as a shooter, shot just 35.5% from 3 but 80% from the line and supposedly shot the ball very well in Combine drills and team workouts. Has great defensive potential with his length and athleticism, and a great steal rate, averaged more than two steals a game (I know that’s inflated with the Louisville defense but not nearly like the Syracuse zone). Gets to the basket a ton but isn’t a good finisher (relatively low free throw rate + only shot 46 from 2Pr). Has a lot of tools of a great player and a lot of potential but there’s another question of BBIQ with him, and if he couldn’t learn it under Pitino then will he? Poor shot selection at times, but you have to question how much that was due to the lack of offense at Louisville. He’s a cross between <span id="big_board" class="comp">Marcus Smart</span> and <span id="big_board" class="comp">Dion Waiters</span> with his confidence, athletic tools, and skillset offensively, and that is absolutely a guy you’d want to have in the NBA. 
<br><br>
<hr id="big_board" class="tier_break">
<br>
<span id="big_board" class="tier_text">Tier 4 - relatively good chance @ above average starter impact</span>
<br><br>
<span id="big_board" class="player_name">10. Frank Ntilikina, Strasbourg IG - </span><br>Big, strong, athletic natural point guard. 7 foot wingspan on 6’6 frame. Has a little bit better shooting touch but slightly worse defensively. Also struggles with being a pure point guard, turns the ball over a lot, unsure whether or not he will ever get there offensively. Has all of the tools you could want in a prospect. Similar questions with Dennis Smith Jr. I’m just worried that he’ll fall into the same category as the other big point guards who can’t shoot and who didn’t play college ball like <span id="big_board" class="comp">Emmanuel Mudiay</span> and <span id="big_board" class="comp">Dante Exum</span>. Although Mudiay still can get better and Exum has turned into an important guy for the Jazz in the playoffs, these guys were still relative busts. I think the same worries apply for Ntilikina. 

<span id="big_board" class="player_name">11. Lauri Markannen, Arizona - </span><br>Not impressed. What separates him from Andrea Bargnani outside of maybe a better three point shot? I understand big guys that can shoot and handle the ball are in high demand in today’s NBA but I don’t think he can defend / rebound well enough to make it worth it. It’s a real toss up for me because having a 6’10 42% potential three point shooter can be such a weapon for a great team, especially one who can create off the dribble a little. I just think he will allow defensively as much as he will produce. Had a worse rebounding percentage than Miles Bridges. His best position in the NBA is probably the 4 but he’s not quick enough to cover tweeners and not big enough to cover bigs. I think he’ll be <span id="big_board" class="comp">Channing Frye</span> for his career. <b>Update 6/17 - </b>After doing some more research on him, I don’t hate him as much as I did earlier. The entire question with Lauri is about that shooting. If he can be a >40% shooter he’ll be a +2 or +3 guy on the offensive side of the ball and he’ll have a long career. If he can’t… I think he’ll be out of the league.
