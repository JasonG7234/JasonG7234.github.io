<h3 style="color: #000;">Philosophy - </h3><br>
<ul>
<li>Value ceiling > floor for lottery selections and end of draft/undrafted guys. Other than the two poles, I value consistent high floor guys who don’t require a ton of developmental resources (coaching focus/system, G-League time, etc.) to reach their peaks.</li>
<li>Emphasis on wings > bigs > guards. You can find so many rotation caliber guards between the G-League and overseas, and also so many go undrafted. Bigs are similar, not quite the same level of production, but guys like Udoh/Birch went overseas, improved their games, and have made a moderate impact as bench bigs. I think wings in that sense are more rare, and therefore more valuable</li>
<li>For the most part, I stick with consensus even when I don't agree with it. For example, I'm low comparatively on someone like Mitchell Robinson for multiple reasons, but considering he is a near lottery pick and was a top 10 recruit, he'll get more opportunites to succeed than someone like Mo Wagner. I have to take that into account. To expand, I like Trier more than Trent in a vacuum. 
<li>In general I like two-way guys who can play in some different lineups and don’t project as liabilities. Basically guys who can play in crunch time and/or playoff games.</li>
<li>I probably underrate age outside of the lottery but I think it overall isn't that important, unless distinguising an 18 year old freshman from a 22 year old senior or similar circumstances.</li>
<li>I understand the tier format doesn't make sense because there is nearly zero chance so many guys make it long term as role players, but it makes sense to me how to envision player skills and archetypes.</li>
<li>Also I know these comparisons suck and it’s bad to compare players and yadda yadda yadda but I think they’re fun so that’s all that matters.</li>
</ul>

<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Zhaire Smith, Texas Tech - </span><br>
<b>Position - </b>6’4 wing who can rim run and grab boards with potential 3 point upside. Game-changing defensive potential, switch 1-4 with rim protection.
<br><b>Positives - </b>6’9 wingspan. I think he’s the best athlete in the draft, his vertical athleticism is absolutely bonkers and he’s really damn quick on the perimeter as well. He skies for rebounds and dunks to the point where it doesn’t even look human. Shooting is his swing skill, but still shot 45% from 3. Mechanics look solid, doesn’t shoot it too much for me to really get a firm grasp of where he needs to improve. Has a lot of lateral explosion, can blow by people off the dribble, although that’s rare. Always looking for something to do on offense, never stands around. Puts a ton of pressure on the defense on the defense that way. Hustles his ass off every play, he sets screens, cuts, rim runs, attacks the glass, etc. Regarding screens, in offensive breakdowns he loves to sets down and flare screens and get guys open, I mean what other freshman does that? He actually has unbelievable feel for the game, it’s not hyperbole. He reads shot attempts for offensive rebounds, looks for cutters when he has the ball. His defense is really damn good and consistent. He’s versatile enough to guard everyone 1-5, spent time on everyone from Trae Young to Azubuike. Loves to defend bigs, is very active and physical with them. Can stick with guards in PoA situations, ideal mirroring technique, and if he gets blown by can still make up for it with a trail block. So active defensively as well off-ball, seems like with time can become the ideal team defender. He even adds a lot of rim protection, 27 at rim blocks this season, insane for a 6’5 wing. It’s so rare to see a guy who is a crazy athlete, has the IQ+feel, and is active and always uses these gifts. He is a rare breed defensively. Advanced stats love him too, BPM of 11.8 (3rd among wings in this class) and high win shares. Grades well according to <a href="https://www.thestepien.com/player-distribution-tool/">TheStepien’s Player Distribution tool</a> with a high floor. Mike Gribanov has pointed out <a href="https://twitter.com/mikegrib8/status/1000477563670577152?s=21">here</a>g that guys who are high-level athletes are prone to unexpected development (Westbrook, Oladipo) and that's the path you have to hope for if you have Smith as a top 10 pick. 
<br><b>Negatives - </b>My worry with him is that he’s a 6’4 center. He lacks elite size even for a 3, which is where he'll probably be played at the most. He has little functional offensive skill with the ball in his hands besides passing. His handle in traffic is poor, his off the dribble shooting is nearly nonexistent, and he has little confidence in his shot. He should have returned to school and worked entirely on his jumper and every aspect that comes with it. Low usage, isn’t a primary or even secondary option offensively and doesn’t project to be one. Shoots sub-50% at the rim on non-dunk attempts, which is a pretty low number until you remember everything near the basket for him is a layup. Perimeter D definitely needs refinement with technique. Sometimes is heavy-footed, sometimes is too jumpy. Occasionally doesn’t use the screen to his advantage and force the guard into it defensively. Although that should improve, no promises. Better at on-ball D when defending dribble penetration, but if his guy catches and is in triple threat he’s more liable to be blown by off first step. 
<br><b>Overall - </b>Zhaire is a super difficult player to evaluate. I can’t remember a prospect with his skillset and frame. I’m not sold the 3 point shooting ever truly gets there but even without it his defensive potential is immense, he checks legitimately every other box. The number of people who can comfortably do everything on the defensive end are so few. He’s got that ability, and he’s worth a top 10 pick.

<br>
<span id="big_board" class="tier_text">Tier 4 - relatively good chance @ above average starter impact</span>
<br><br>
<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Miles Bridges, Michigan State - </span><br>
<b>Position - </b> Ideal modern forward with ability to play 3 or 4 depending on lineup composition.
<br><b>Positives - </b>You can’t talk about Bridges without talking about his physical profile. He has a clear-cut NBA-ready frame with a strong lower body. His vertical athleticism is fantastic, he has crazy hops to sky for lobs and rebounds, and can go up off one foot or two. Has shown an unbelievable amount of progress as a shooter considering he had the reputation of a liability in HS (26% from 3 in EYBL). In college he improved from 68.5% from the line as a freshman to 85.4%, and he was hovering around 90% for most of the year. His 3 point shooting numbers dipped slightly but he played with two bigs more often than last year. His mechanics seem foundational, just a simple and consistent movement. Can shoot off of movement, always stays balanced, and no problems about shooting in iso situations. Loves to hesitate with the ball in his hands and then pull when his defender least expects it. Attacks closeouts with abandon, usually settles for a pull-up jumper but can get all the way to the basket if he wants. More of a finesse finisher surprisingly, never tries to posterize guys. Surprisingly shifty handle, can create with it, although not his go-to tool. Shown some flashes of playmaking ability, more recognition of floor openings and mismatches than defense manipulation however. Smart and decisive ball mover, some P&R upside. Still within the realm of outcomes at the NBA level for him to be able to create for others. Strong rebounder for his size, even when you consider the fact that he almost exclusively played with two other bigs, helped a ton by his vertical. Defense is fine, not great but not bad. Excels at using his frame to absorb contact and stick with his man. Can stick with most guys long enough to bring in help if he needs, plus is switchable because of that frame. He was so effective for the MSU defense because he could cover 1 through 5 if need be. Can function as a help-side rim protector, has a few impressive reads rotating over for some blocks. Finally, the dude is clutch. Besides just the Purdue shot, I’ve seen him play at Rutgers and the dude sucked the life out of the crowd with every shot. He lives for big moments. 
<br><b>Negatives - </b>Only 6’7.5 with a 6’9.5 wingspan, average numbers to play the 4, where I think a good portion of his value comes from. He’s also better off at the 4 because of his lack of high-end quickness and/or speed. In a straight line he has always been unimpressive to me, just struggles moving his large frame around, especially in transition. Quickness isn’t great, it’s fine, but he doesn’t have the stop-and-go acceleration from a standstill. He’s a good shooter but settles for jumpers way too often. He’s not quick at all off the dribble so it makes sense but he’s a freak of an athlete who can dunk on anyone. Relies on closeouts or picks to get to the rim, and very rarely does he throw down in traffic. Not a strong righty finisher, almost all lefty. Only 27% of his shots at rim, less than 2pt jumpers. Low FT rate, which isn’t that shocking now that we discussed he is more of a shooter, but disappointing considering how good of a FT shooter he is. Would love to see him as the screener in some P&R sets, with his frame if he learns how to set screens he could force switches. Defense is neutral, prone to ball-watch and lose track of his man though. Doesn’t anticipate the game quite as well as some of the other guys do on both ends of the floor. It might come with time, but I’m not overly sure how likely that is. He’s not a defensive thinker of the game, he reacts to what happens on the court, and usually for him that’s enough of a positive at the college level. Mentioned elsewhere, I believe Sam Vecenie’s podcast, that he has the type of frame that may gain weight easily. 
<br><b>Overall - </b>Bridges is a guy without major flaws. I would guess he projects as a +2 guy on O and at least neutral on D, and anyone who doesn’t take away value on either side of the ball is super impactful. I don’t think he’s an upside guy quite like Zhaire, but there’s no feasible way he doesn’t carve out a role. 
<br><b>Comparison - </b>JZ Mazlish brought up <a href="https://twitter.com/jzmazlish/status/974817475174064128?s=12">here</a> the similarities to a rich man's <span id="big_board" class="comp">Mario Hezonja</span>.
<br><br>
<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Collin Sexton, Alabama - </span><br>
<b>Position - </b>Athletic on-guard with creation and P&R upside. Potential PoA defender who competes. 
<br><b>Positives - </b>6’7 wingspan. Does a lot of things very well, and has a lot of the mental and physical tools teams crave in a prospect. Mentally, the dude is a crazy competitor. Contagious work ethic, <a href="http://www.cw.ua.edu/article/2018/04/s-alabama-basketball-collin-sexton-impact-nba-draft">they had to force Sexton out of the gym at times</a>, which I think is one of the single most important qualities in a prospect. He’s cold-blooded, wants the ball in his hands at all times and especially in clutch situations. Plus, Avery Johnson calls a ton of plays, Good quick twitch athlete with lateral explosion and high end speed. Better vertical explosion than given credit for, won the McDonald’s Slam Dunk Contest. Offensively has a fantastic starting skillset. Good equity as a shot creator including surprisingly deep range on his jumper, can attack the rim, create for others, everything you could ask for. Supreme confidence in his jumper and can use his handle and quickness to get to his shots from anywhere in the floor, makes some mistakes with the ball but always looks to be confident. Has a pretty solid floater which he’ll need to continue to improve at. Jumper is mechanically sound, his transition from dribble to pull-up is super efficient and will continue to get stronger. Synergy rates him very highly in P&R ball handling/passing (top 10 percentile) which is his top skill in college. Has a nice stop and start ability to go along with that. Footwork on drives is great, is shifty and is good at snaking around guys on occasion or barrelling through them. Crazy high FTr, loves to attack bigger guys and draw fouls. Defense is solid, he plays engaged, quick feet, stays active, doesn’t make mistakes usually. 
<br><b>Negatives - </b>I’ve seen concerns that Sexton will not be a good player because teams would be committing so much to a player who has caps as an average player in that position, and having a median point guard isn’t an avenue towards team success. I can understand that take. Only 6'1, below average height for a point guard. Doesn’t use his length as much as you’d expect. He’s good at a few things and projects well but other than his mentality isn’t great at anything. Shooting is solid but only around 34% from 3, not ideal. His unguarded catch-and-shoot numbers are bottom 20% on Synergy, which is a skill I would expect him to get better at if he’s playing off the ball more in the NBA. Speaking of, he really needs to improve as an off-ball player which isn’t a role he’s had to play before in his life. Driving ability is solid but decision-making lapses in terms of whether to shoot/pass, forces things. HIs passing ability is another major question mark, lowest APG numbers I’ve seen in a primary creator in a long time. I think that’s because although he’s capable of making simple reads he’s not a high level passer, nor is it his first instinct. If he sees someone open in front of him he can make the pass but can’t create for others like he can for himself. Some draft experts smarter than I am have questioned his handle, saying he lacks smoothness and is inefficient. I’ll let others draw their own conclusions from that. Prefers his right hand, even on the left side of the rim. Can struggle sometimes finishing against length. Defensively gets lost off-ball from watching or reaches/over helps, I’m going to hope those are freshmen problems because they are serious concerns. IQ isn’t always there he is just competitive as hell but I don’t really know if that’s all that matters.  According to net ratings, Alabama was (slightly) worse with him on the floor, mostly defensively. <br><b>Overall - </b>Every positive he has is basically offset by an equal negative, and that’s not something you want to see in a potential lottery guy. I understand guards are a dime a dozen in the NBA and you shouldn’t commit to just an average one, but his work ethic is so important to me. He’s a guy who wants to win more than anything, and his teammates love him. That’s something I value incredibly high.
<br><b>Comparison - </b>I don’t love the <span id="big_board" class="comp">Eric Bledsoe</span> comparison. I’m going to go out on a limb here and say I see <span id="big_board" class="comp">Goran Dragic/Jeff Teague</span> in his game, mixed with <span id="big_board" class="comp">Marcus Smart’s</span> tenacity. 
<br><br>

<br>
<span id="big_board" class="tier_text">Tier 5 - relatively moderate chance @ average starter impact</span>
<br><br>
<span id="big_board" class="player_name"> Josh Okogie, Georgia Tech - </span><br>
<b>Position - </b>Long wing with no obvious weaknesses. Great defendser, primarily on 2s, some 1s and 3s.
<br><b>Positives - </b>7’0 wingspan is an insane number for a wing. In very good shape, barely over 5% body fat and ripped. Crazy athlete both vertically and laterally , most impressive Combine scores of any prospect this year, who applies this athleticism every play. Surprising shooting profile - 38% from 3 and over 80% from the line. Relied upon to create offense for Georgia Tech, high USG% at 27.3, which explains some of his inefficiencies. Strong scoring instinct always in attack mode, especially in transition. Competitor with high FTr, consistently puts pressure on the defense. Lives on attacking closeouts. Has some equity as self-creator due to aggressive nature. Smooth motion into shooting off the dribble, very comfortable with getting to that shot in the mid-range in a variety of ways: spins, fades, pull-ups, etc.  Improved as lefty driver and finisher. High bball IQ in terms of keeping/moving the ball, a good extra pass/ball mover guy. On defense, could in time turn into lockdown defender of guards/ small wings. Really good at using his chest to stay with the offensive player and reaching with his long arms at the ball. Really light feet to stay attached on drives. Best wing defender I’ve seen at getting through screens, he hustles if he gets hit hard to recover, but otherwise always jumps in front of the screen and rides his man. Covers a lot of ground on his closeouts, really fights to get a piece of jump shots or change the shooter’s shot.
<br><b>Negatives - </b> Inconsistent misses, some are short, long, left, right, not a huge deal but doesn’t bring up too much confidence in his shooting profile. Really poor finisher, under 55% at the rim with 44% of those being assisted, bottom 10 percentile. He’s had to take a lot of difficult shots for their offense, but those numbers are bottom 5 for a wing prospect in this draft. To extend that, generally an inefficient scorer from all over the floor  because of these shots. If he’s not engaged on offense with the ball in his hands he is unimpactful as an off-ball player, and I’m worried his catch & shoot numbers will reflect this in the NBA, which were average in college. AST/TO ratio under 1, brings up some questions about his IQ. Not a high-level passer/creator for others, doesn’t really look for a skip pass or drive and kick. drives. The worst percentile as ball handler in a P&R according to Synergy, I knew he was bad just not THAT bad. I don’t love his handle, not close enough to him or strong enough to not be poked away. Plus, he just throws the ball forward sometimes to split defenders and is generally careless with it. I’ve noticed a few small complaints about his defense, inconsistent bumping and rotating where he needs to, especially on rub actions. Maybe it’s GT scheme to try to have the ball defender recover with effort but doesn’t hedge. Still needs defensive polish, cheats the screen and is eligible to lose his man if they fake toward the pick. Also, he’s so aggressive on that end he is susceptible to step-backs or spins. He can also be lazy in transition, can reach or just not hustle back, but I’ll give him a pass due to creation burden.
<br><b>Overall - </b>There’s not much to dislike about Okogie considering his offensive potential, defensive profile, and elite athleticism. His floor and ceiling combination make him more worthwhile to me than other similar wings because there’s low risk and high reward, unlike someone like Jacob Evans with low risk and comparatively lower reward. I am a little worried about his practical offensive skills, but Okogie's combination of functional athleticism and high-level instincts lead me to think there's a lot of untapped potential. 
<br><b>Comparison - </b><span id="big_board" class="comp">Josh Richardson</span>
<br><br>
<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Chandler Hutchison, Boise State - </span><br>
<b>Position - </b>Clear modern 3 with ability to play small ball 4. 
<br><b>Positives - </b>6-foot-7 senior wing with a 7-foot-1 wingspan. Good athlete with a great first step. Solid scoring profile @ 20ppg, much improved shot-taker and maker. Had such an insane creation burden for Boise State, they relied on him for legitimately everything within their offense, USG% at 33.2. Upped his 3pt% to 36 and FT% to 72.5. It’s evident how much work has went into his mechanics, I really like how his body flows when shooting, one fluid motion. Gotten a lot better at catching off the hop in rhythm. Pretty good finisher around the basket - 72% at the rim on only 27.2% assisted, can finish with either hand. High FTr, averaged over 7 FTA/game. Nice footwork, loves to step through whether after a jump stop or sort of a euro. Long strider, really attacks the rim in the half court and puts emphasis on the defense, especially with the ball in transition. Draws a ton of his fouls that way. Relishes in attacking closeouts, very good at catching while moving to give himself forward momentum to attack. This package of attacking the basket is a real skill he has. Willing passer, every game I’ve seen of him he gets his teammates open looks and they just don’t convert, really good at hitting shooters on kickouts. Defensively is a mixed bag. Smart rotations, I’ve seen a few solid stunts and recovers, seeing one pass ahead. Rates well above average at Jackson Hoy’s defense rating in his draft database. Very strong work ethic <a href="https://www.si.com/nba/2017/12/13/nba-draft-chandler-hutchison-boise-state-weber-state-damian-lillard">as discussed in SI.</a> 
<br><b>Negatives - </b>Had the 4th best net rating on Boise State, not that I put much merit into those kinds of statistics. Lots of question marks regarding his shooting considering his senior season is the first in which he shot over 70% from the line. Needs to refine his midrange game, has some preliminary skills but it is by no means a weapon. Don’t have the Synergy numbers but seems like he lacks touch on his floaters. Not exactly a negative but he’s more of a drive-and-kick passer than a pick and roll one, whenever he gets a pick he never hits the roll man. Expanding off that, lackluster handle, very simple/linear, has no way to wow you with it, sort of limits his passing upside if he can’t leverage his drive and kick abilities. Turns the ball over a ton, barely positive AST/TO ratio, due in part to having such a creation burden for his team but also has a loose handle and gets it stripped while driving. Defensively seems a tiny bit slow IQ wise, liable to be out of position/not give effort. Usually it’s by the basket or on shooters because he just can’t risk fouling. That’s why it’s a mixed bag, are his lapses due to being so needed offensively or is he just an inconsistent defender?
<br><b>Overall - </b>Hutchison is a guy who is dependent on how his game would differ in an off-ball role. If you think his efficiency would shoot up without such a high creation burden then he’s a first rounder. If you think for better or for worse he is who he is, then you’re not as high on him. I always bet on work ethic, and he seems to have it.
<br><b>Comparison - </b><span id="big_board" class="comp">Kyle Kuzma</span>
<br><br>
<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Kevin Huerter, Maryland - </span><br>
<b>Position - </b>Off-ball wing with secondary creation ability. Length allows him to defend other wings effectively. 
<br><b>Positives - </b>6’7 is good size for a wing, with long arms. Tested surprisingly well at the Combine, showed off his vertical explosion with above average vertical numbers and displayed quickness in bursts. Huerter’s NBA-level skillset starts with his shooting ability. He shot 41.7% from 3, smooth stroke and gets into his release quickly. Has shown marked improvement as a scorer from freshman to sophomore year, improved his efficiency everywhere. Shot 52% from midrange this year, the highest of any prospect in the last 4 years in my database. He is in the top quarter percentile in every spot on the floor comparative to other wings according to TheStepien’s shot chart. Huerter’s IQ is also evident when watching him play, he’s a smart ball mover who recognizes openings and knows where his teammates are. Reactionary passer, takes what the defense gives him, reads doubles and finds the open man. Projects to be a capable secondary playmaker who can attack closeouts and rotate the ball effectively. Rates in the 97th percentile as a P&R ball handler according to Synergy. High IQ extends to cutting and backdoor plays where he is >70% at the rim. Actually fights for offensive boards, takes his guy and hustles when his man doesn’t expect. In both of these types of plays, vertical pop is evident. Good one-on-one defense, keeps arms out wide and gets into the chest of his man. High IQ extends to team defense, brings smart help and rotates effectively. Doesn’t try to cheat screens, usually in the right place when guarding off-ball and navigating action. Underrated shot blocker with help defense but more common getting pieces of shots at the rim. 
<br><b>Negatives - </b>The idea of him being long is moreso just because he’s lanky with sunken chest, only a 6’7.5 wingspan. Needs to add effective weight+strength, both for defense and finishing at the basket. Struggles getting through tough picks currently. Synergy has him right around average in terms of shooting off screens. Barely shooting above 75% at the line which raises a few eyebrows as to his true shooting ability. I think that’s because he relies so much on his lower body to power the shot instead of his arms/wrists, and I think that’s where he loses a lot of the accuracy. He doesn’t really aim the same way on his jumpers as he does on his FTs. Also an important thing, doesn’t have a high release point, which minimizes part of the appeal of his size. Good ball handler but lacking when driving and creating separation. Doesn’t have any shake or handle in iso setting so very limited there, relies on teammates to get his open shots. Really relies on attacking closeouts/off-ball action to score inside, over 50% of his shots are assisted. Can force the issue, for a supposed passer and secondary playmaker only has an AST/TO ratio of 1.3. Doesn’t create impactful defensive plays, barely over 1 steal per 100 possessions. Not always reliable perimeter defender, seems to stand flat-footed on occasion when helping one pass away. He’s got a solid toolset to build upon but you don’t even notice he’s on the floor half the time. Seems like he floats through games, doesn’t look to be that invested in the outcome. I think that’s just who he is. 
<br><b>Overall - </b>Huerter’s size, shooting, and playmaking are apparent and make for a near ideal off-ball offensive player. I’m high on Shamet for similar reasons, and Huerter is bigger and better. If he adds muscle to his chest and arms, Huerter could end up as a top 3 wing in this class.

<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Jalen Brunson, Villanova - </span><br>
<b>Position - </b>On-guard creator, off-ball talent as a shooter and ball mover. Strictly a PG defender and projects to be below average.
<br><b>Positives - </b>Upperclassmen and unequivocal leader for Villanova, won 2 championships in 3 seasons. Unbelievable offensive talent, historically efficient at everything he was asked to do. His scoring and self-creation numbers are insane. He has the single highest offensive self-creation of anyone in my database, the first dude to hit 100. Splits at 52.1/40.8/80.2, 63.5% TS, 51.5% on 2 pt jumpers with only 3.4% of those being assisted, above 70% at the rim with only 20% of that being assisted... dude's next level. He is up there with Buddy and Jimmer as best offensive talents the last few years in college basketball. His post-up game is legit, can punish smaller guards on him and is actually efficient with his little step-back he has. Has a lefty floater he uses a ton if he can’t get all the way to the rim. He also exhibits total control when handling the ball, always plays two steps ahead (ie drive then headfake opens up interior pass). He’s gifted in the P&R, creates for himself and others, and rarely makes mistakes. Just always in control. I think he is the best offensive player in this draft, better than Ayton and Doncic. Defensively is mostly a negative but to me half of defense at the NBA level is effort, and he gives it. He hustles more than most, even with his offensive burden. His IQ manifests itself in this regard too, doesn’t really make mistakes. I think his strength is key on this end and even makes up for his lack of athleticism & length in some regards. Also, keep in mind <a href="https://twitter.com/Mike_Schmitz/status/980259375381204992">NBA executives want guys from Nova</a> for a reason. They’re hard-working, fundamentally sound, and tough as hell. Brunson is no exception.  
<br><b>Negatives - </b>I’m going to be nitpicking here. 6’2 with a 6’3.5 wingspan is not good for an NBA player. His size is the biggest hump he'll have to overcome to be effective in the NBA. Atleticism has long been maligned, he tested above average at the Combine but needs a lot to overcome lack of size and length. Offensively the only question marks are the consistency of his catch-and-shoot numbers and his post game. Last season he was in the bottom half of C&S numbers which means that facet of his game could be a tiny bit flukey. Shot 37% from 3 from NBA range which is solid but not as extraordinary as you’d expect (you can really tell I’m digging deep here). His post up game was good but against college guards, and NBA provides different monsters. Probably won’t be a plus, at least for a few years. Seems to go out of his way to finish lefty when he should just go up righty. Plus, his game is a lot of in-between stuff, mid-range jumpers and floaters that don’t exactly have a place in the current NBA. Doesn’t have the highest net rating on the team, that’s Bridges, which probably has more to do with their lack of wings than anything else. Finally, defense. His length is a big question mark here, he’ll have to almost exclusively guard PGs, of which there are so many great ones who could torch him. He’s going to be a negative on that end, which isn’t crazily detrimental to a team but could make the difference between a starter and a high-end backup. PG is one of the easiest positions to find good replacements for overseas, so if you’re drafting him you have to hope he’s starter quality. 
<br><b>Overall - </b>To me his positives are so much more important than the negatives. He’ll be one of the better offensive players in the NBA as a rookie, with no significant flaws on that end of the floor. He’s a high character guy who works his ass off consistently. I think he can be a starter, and a good one at that.

<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Jacob Evans, Cincinnati - </span><br>
<b>Position - </b>Prototypical 3&D wing with secondary P&R ability. Positive team defender used to switching.
<br><b>Positives - </b>Evans is a very consistent and even-keeled player. To start with his shot, he’s really become a consistently great shooter. 37% from 3 on 4.5 attempts per game, easily his best offensive skill. Good mechanics, no extraneous movement, well-balanced. Loves getting to his pull-up, one of the few guys who is just as good catch and shoot as he is off the dribble. High proclivity to shoot off movement, whether it be screen action or relocation. Has been playing a little point guard at 6’6 as evidenced by averaging 3.1 assists per game, most on the team. Doesn’t make too many mistakes, just makes the pass the defense gives him, 1.79 AST/TO ratio. Has some P&R upside too surprisingly, top 5 percentile as P&R ball handler. Averaged 2.3 stocks per game, makes an impact on the game on both ends. Very solid high IQ team defender, smart understanding of positionality and rotations and overall defensive concepts. Seems like he always knows whether to switch/hedge. Crisp rotations, 23 at rim blocks are a good baseline to show that he gets to the spots before the offense can. Strong upper body he uses to keep with bigger guys and also finish through contact. Has one of the highest 3nD and Defense ratings in Jackson Hoy’s database. Highest plus-minus on the team, higher than advanced stat darling Gary Clark. 
<br><b>Negatives - </b>Seems like a pretty average athlete with a slightly below average frame. 6’5.5 with a 6'9 wingspan is typical for an NBA wing, so not exactly a negative but I'm reaching here. Athletic ability is probably behind similar NBA 3nD wings. Also, he is a good shooter by eye test and by the stats but 75% from the line and 37% from 3 are not the splits of a deadeye marksman. 35% from midrange jumpers is equally uninspiring. I don’t love his shot fake, not a tool that can be used effectiely. ALso, he doesn’t really like to attack closeouts, he either takes the first shot presented in front of him regardless of defense or takes one step in and shoots a midrange jumper. Doesn’t strike me as a great finisher inside when he does get there, can’t fully blow by guys so he kind of settles for some tough righty floater often. Not a high-level passer, most of his assists are off simple ball movement or entry passes. His one on one defense is good, not great, probably the worst part of his defensive package. But in a vacuum it is above average, so not exactly a negative. I’ve had some questions about aggression, always looks very passive. Kawhi-esque. Just seems like he floats mentally and that he doesn’t want to be out there, I’m not saying that’s the case that’s just the appearance. 
<br><b>Overall - </b>In this class I’m unsure you can find a more ideal 3nD player. 6’6 athletes who can defend and shoot it don’t grow on trees and I think he’s the type of guy that every team could use. He takes almost nothing off the table, and you can easily imagine him in a few years playing meaningful minutes in a playoff game.

<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Kentucky -  </span><br>
<b>Position - </b>On-ball P&R primary creator with plus guard defense 
<br><b>Positives - </b> 6’6 with a 6'11.5 wingspan as primary creator, and able to guard smalls? Super rare physical profile. He really controls the game as a true freshman, Cal gave him an unusual amount of slack as the offensive fulcrum, Shai called a few plays in the flow of the offense. Very surprising shooting numbers - 82.2% from the line, 40.4% from 3, 37.9% on 2pt jumpers with an incredible creation burden. But most of his offensive value is from his creation abilities in the P&R, both for himself and others. Can make any play with the ball in his hands, kicks it to shooters, finishes at the basket, gets to his spots. Has a nice little hesitation change of pace to his game, pretty good at splitting the P&Rs, usually a rare skill for college freshmen. With that, probably the best guard in this class at jailing the P&R defender and patiently attacking, is really good at maneuvering in tight situations. Another thing, really good at using his pivot foot to jab step and create space when waiting for a pick.  Has a really quick between the legs dribble he loves. Good aggressive nature attacking the basket and finishing through contact. Cole Zwicker uses the term “length explosion” which is how Shai is still a good finisher despite the athletic deficiencies, and I really like that term. Really high FTr, his constant driving game (and to a smaller degree lack of good first step) really lends itself to drawing fouls. On defense I think he’s fine, I haven’t seen him challenged too often. Usually moves his feet enough to rely on length to contest. Team defense is good, not great but good, doesn’t make too many mistakes. Clutch player.
<br><b>Negatives - </b> I’m really, really low on his athletic ability. In terms of acceleration and/or pure speed, I’d much rather have someone like Brunson. He really relies on his length to be effective in a lot of areas, more than any other prospect. His lack of upper body muscle really manifests itself on defense, he’ll bulk up with time so not much of a long term issue I don’t envision.Struggles with guards bulldozing him. I think there are a lot of underrated offensive question marks associated with his playstyle that are often overlooked. For one, how good of a shooter will he become? His splits are fine but his lack of confidence in his shot is obvious and I don’t love his mechanics, seem very jerky and rigid. They’re currently slow enough where I can’t imagine him shooting over a fast closeout. Also, his floaters always seem to bounce around the rim 3 or 4 times. Next, despite his unusually advanced P&R IQ he makes a ton of bone-headed decisions. Prone to going too fast before the pick is set, getting charges drawn against him, getting trapped. Plays like a freshman at times basically. Tries to handle in traffic when he can’t, fails against pressure. Jevon Carter isn’t the best guard to extrapolate from man he had Shai spooked all night. I don’t love his defense either, I feel like solid guards will be able to blow by him, even with Gilgeous-Alexander being able to move his hips so well. I am skeptical how he can hang athletically. 
<br><b>Overall - </b>After watching more film of Shai, he’s a lot more like Sexton than I thought. Both are super ball-dominant players who are inefficient shooters and have the potential to limit an offense. No one thinks about that with Shai because his length allows him to cover 2s and therefore exist in an off-ball role, but he’d be horribly misused in that way. I’ve soured on him quickly.

<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Landry Shamet, Wichita State - </span><br>
<b>Position - </b>On or off-ball game, C&S shooter or P&R creator. Guards 1s&2s with high IQ.
<br><b>Positives - </b>Long 6’5 frame with long arms, good size for a “point guard.” Really skilled, cerebral player. Most of his offensive value comes from his shooting - 44% from 3, 82.5% from the line, and a 65.5% TS, one of the 3 highest in this class. Just a confident, consistent 3 point shooter who could shoot off the dribble just as easily as off the catch. Really nice footwork when catching, comes off the hop, clean, pointed toes at the rim. Also is efficient at shooting off jab steps and in sort of iso situations, just a very balanced shooter. Leverages his jumper with a phenomenal pump fake, gets guys in the air consistently, no wasted motion. With his shot comes a lot of pull-up 2s, shot 37.5% on 9.5% assisted, good but not great. Has a variety of step-backs and fades to get his points there. Relatively strong self-creator. Keeps a tight handle, relies on it to get to the basket where he shot 71.5% at the rim. He can be a true offensive point because he excels in P&R as well. His Synergy stats are insane, in the top percentile of running the P&R and the second percentile in guarded C&S, etc. Second to his shooting, his decision making is his best quality. He just makes very few mistakes with the ball. AST/TO ratio is almost 2.5, over 5 assists a game, always in control. Keeps his head on a swivel, just very, very good at reading and reacting. If he finds a mismatch he attacks it, swings the ball for open shots, locates shooters, everything you could want in a player. I love his off-ball movement, knows when to drift corner or float up, screen down, etc. Just feels the game on another level. That extends to defense, although on an unfortunately lesser scale. Still reads, reacts, rotates. Watches two guys. When guarding on an island does a good job of mirroring and staying with his guy, not the lightest feet but they get the job done. Length helps a lot too. Also a better athlete than he looks, has some vertical pop to him you don’t think about. 
<br><b>Negatives - </b>Could benefit from beefing up, made strides with arms but could use stronger chest and lower body. Can get knocked off his spots when driving and especially when defending. Struggles finishing inside against length, he shot well at the rim but half of those were assisted, which means that he converted mostly layups off passes. I think that’s important because it shows how lackluster he is at creating separation and getting to the rim. Also, liable to force the issue if his team can’t create offense. I doubt this would be a problem in the NBA but who knows. Low stock numbers is definitely cause for concern, I like his defense in a vacuum but he doesn’t really impact the game much. He can always be in the right spot, but if he doesn’t make plays and alter the offense’s gameplan, how much is that really worth?
<br><b>Overall - </b>There’s a lot to like with Shamet’s game. Combine his shooting with his IQ and you have a real NBA talent. He has an admittedly low ceiling but guys who just feel the game are guys that inevitably stick around longer than they should.

<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Robert Williams, Texas A&M - </span><br>
<b>Position - </b>Rim runner big man at 6’10. Good defensive instincts and can switch or drop in a P&R scheme.
<br><b>Positives - </b>I was so high on Williams last year, even had him top 10. His physical gifts are unparalleled. Is one of the best athletes in the class irrespective of size, monster vertical off one or two feet, skies for putbacks, lobs, or rebounds. Quick into the jump, his explosion is real. Really impressive laterally as well, when engaged can defend on the perimeter exceptionally well, has the lower body power and finesse needed there, along with length. Hasn’t gone through public Combine testing so he was last measured at 6’10 with a 7’5.5 wingspan. Offensively Williams is really lacking in solid skills but has shown flashes of talent in all areas. Obviously his dynamism is evident, but has shown passing and shooting flashes. Makes some short roll reads, hit the other big with some drop-down passes and can hit perimeter shooters. Face-up game has improved, shot 40% on 2-pt jumpers this season. Even with these aforementioned flashes of skills, doesn’t use a lot of possessions offensively, knows his role. Great rebounder, over 9 a game, vertical explosion helps a ton. Can grab in traffic over bigger guys. Most of his value comes from defense, especially rim protection. 44 at rim blocks this season and he played most of this season as a 4. He has elite anticipation when he actually tries to block shots, also has 21 blocks on 2-pt jumpers and 10 blocks on threes (!!!). His steal numbers are strong as well, 1.8 per 100 possessions, good hands + quickness + anticipation is a good combination. I’ve talked about his lateral quickness, he can guard on the perimeter well when engaged. Most of his value is theoretical, and if he reaches his defensive peak of good perimeter D for a big along with rim protection, he can anchor a defense. On/Off numbers show A&M is much better when Williams is in at the 5 without Tyler Davis, which shows Williams is better as true center. I also think because of Davis, RobWill didn’t get to play his true position as a 5. If he could anchor a defense, he would not have to worry about guarding on the perimeter so often. His rim protection is more of a strength consistently.
<br><b>Negatives - </b>Returning from school, Williams didn’t show any major improvement at all. Offensively, his FT shooting dropped to 47%, really disappointing. Fell in love with his midrange jumper way too much, 36% of his shots were from there, not ideal even if he improved his percentages. Just not an efficient shot if it’s not automatic. Seems kind of passive offensively, doesn’t take advantage of mismatches, it’s clear his IQ isn’t there on that level. Doesn’t have too many real offensive skills with the ball in his hands, zero left hand. Ideally he would set solid screens and roll hard but he rarely does. I mentioned it has to do with system and fit at A&M which is true but effort should always be there. I think the biggest problem for WIlliams though, which has been there since freshman year, is his inconsistency. Effort level wanes, ideally you’d like him to use his vertical and energy consistently on the offensive glass. Defensively, even with relatively few minutes per game, he isn’t as aggressive as he should be. Needs to bulk up lower body specifically to handle bigger post threats consistently, and has to balance that bulk without giving up lateral agility. Can be too heavy-footed when not engaged, which is more often than it should be. It’s had for me to complain legitimate problems with his defense because most of it is effort, engagement, and consistency. Those problems are really tough to eliminate unless he has a great coaching staff to help him. Has a surprisingly poor net rating, his team was marginally worse with him on the floor at 6 points per 100 possessions.
<br><b>Overall - </b> I really want Robert Williams to reach his best possible outcome - a freakish athlete of a big man who hustles every time he’s on the floor, demands attention as a roll man and lob threat, and offers switchable rim protection on defense. He won’t get anywhere near that sadly, and I think it takes him a very long time to get return on investment if he isn’t in an ideal situation.

<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Keita Bates-Diop, Ohio State - </span><br>
<b>Position - </b>Spot-up shooter with some secondary skills, defends 3s and 4s with smart rotations. 
<br><b>Positives - </b> 6’7 forward with a 7’4 wingspan(!!!) and uses every bit of it. Much improved shooter from all over the floor with an incredibly high release point. Only shot 36% from 3 but 79.4% from the line and 44% from 2 point jumpers, top 20 percentile according to Synergy. Speaking of Synergy, rates as above average in nearly all scoring situations outside of iso scoring (not his play type) and guarded catch-and-shoot (in which he barely missed). Therefore, most of his scoring indicators are good, and his length + release intersection should allow for him to make similar shooting splits once he gets his feet wet at the NBA level. Uses head fakes and shifty crossovers to make up for his lack of quickness.  Solid finisher, has good touch with a nice righty floater and his length is super useful around the basket and getting to the line. Can post up, use his length to score inside or face up and shoot over top His passing is solid, the 98th percentile according to Synergy in creating for others. Offensively brings a lot to the table and projects as someone who’s skills would extend to an off-ball role. Defensively he’s also really solid, understanding team concepts and rotating. He hits the 3 R’s I look at: he reads, he reacts, and he rotates. He defends the point of attack well because of his length, his contests are incredible and he rarely fouls. His shot-blocking is legitimate and one of the best for a wing prospect in recent years. Solid rebounder and transition defender. Doesn’t take anything off the table. Team is .3 points per possession better with him on the court which shows his value.
<br><b>Negatives - </b> Gonna be almost 22.5 on draft day, so he’s not an upside guy who’s going to improve a ton. High chance his shooting numbers are flukey, has regressed over the course of the season and are a crazy high step up from previous years. Plus, if it takes him a while to shoot, it’s hard to justify playing an off-ball player who can’t space the floor even if they’re a high level team defender. I personally expect it will take Bates-Diop 1 or 2 full seasons to reach around 36% from 3, which isn’t bad necessarily but something you have to keep in mind. Zero ability to finish with his left hand. The other problem with him is he has next to no explosion laterally and does not create any separation. He can use his length to finish but if he’s not attacking closeouts and beating a defender with his momentum going the other way he will never blow by a guy. Also I talked about his passing and although Synergy rates him highly his AST/TO ratio is negative and his AST% isn’t high so I don’t know what to think of all these stats. When I watch him play he seems to make the right decision as a passer more often than not.  
<br><b>Overall - </b>Not a sexy pick by any means but Bates-Diop is going to be an NBA player for a long time coming as long as he can shoot. Doesn’t make too many mistakes in general. I think his archetype as a team defender who can shoot always has a spot in the NBA.

<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Mitchell Robinson, High School - </span><br>
<b>Position - </b>Big true 7 footer as a rim runner and protector. 
<br><b>Positives - </b> 7’1 in shoes with a 7’4 wingspan and a 9’3 standing reach. Video game like physical frame, just a freak. Agile moving around in space. Soft hands and good hand-eye coordination to catch tough passes. Actually runs like a gazelle, huge strides with great high-end speed. There’s no reason he should be have the fluidity to jump as high as he does or move as fast as he does. DeAndre Jordan-esque sort of athlete as a 7 footer, that is by far his most translatable NBA “skill” and compared to other go-to skills for top prospect it might be the best. Should translate immediately as a lob catcher and rebounder, along with strong rim protection. Showed some flashes of a jumper in high school with surprisingly decent results, nice high arc.Has been rumored to have worked on his jumper and handle recently, as Mike Gribanov explains here. Not sure how important that skill is compared to adding muscle and learning defensive fundamentals but I’m no trainer nor should I be criticizing improvement. Great timing when blocking shots, most of it is due to just being bigger than his high school competition but even led the EYBL in blocks per 36 minutes. Speaking of EYBL, played well against other top competition and was right up there with the other bigs in his class like Bagley, Ayton, Carter, Bamba, etc. You could argue he was more dominant than any of them. If you can get him in the right system and demonstrate patience with his development, he can become an incredible impact player. Also, there’s no questions about his work ethic considering he’s been working on his skills a ton since dropping out of WKU. 
<br><b>Negatives - </b>Super frail. Does not have a low center of gravity because of his lack of muscle and long legs. Let’s hope he’s been bulking up during his hiatus. Starts his shot a little low and has a tiny hitch before getting to its apex, doesn’t look pretty. I’m just unsure of how his shot can progress and whether or not it can become a weapon, or, partially because the more time spent out on the perimeter hitting at best like 32% of his 3s would mean that he’s not inside going for offensive rebounds. Really seems to be lacking in touch around the basket, only has the ability to dunk. Ineffective post game. Doesn’t seem to be much of a passer at all, or even a decision maker at all, really lacking that feel for the game that I think is so important. Has a very linear game in that regard. Another thing, it looks like he’s never been coached before, honestly impressive. Has no fundamentals, refined techniques or anything resembling. Finally, I think his biggest weakness is his mental approach to the game. First, I know the reasons for his exit from WKU were legitimate but you gotta wonder if the unique off-the-court distractions will continue in the NBA. To go along with that, the character questions surrounding his two college decommitments (and three high schools) along with his reserved and awkward outward personality really could be indicative of bigger issues. Pete Philo, international scout, says that the key to development is through playing in game and getting reps, which Robinson has gotten none of. Keep in mind this is an actual paid scout, and not some scrub pretending to be Milos Teodosic on the internet.
<br><b>Overall - </b>Basically this evaluation has been written through the lens of Mike Gribanov because I don’t really have any other frame of reference on him. In terms of his skill/archetype, he is an NBA prospect due entirely to his athletic profile. Those types of players always give me pause because he might be just another guy when he reaches the next level.

<b>Position - </b>Offensive big game, post ups and some improved C&S proclivity, versatile defender and swiss army knife, switch 2-4 comfortably.
<br><b>Positives - </b>He does all the things that don’t end up in box scores, and all the things coaches love. 6’7.5 forward with a 7 foot wingspan who hustles his ass off. Advanced stats LOVE him - Led all Division 1 basketball players in WS/40, BPM, DRTG. <a href="https://nbamath.com/2017-18-ncaa-tpa/">#3 in NBAMath’s Total Points Added metric</a>. Player most similar to Draymond Green in college (determined by Jackson Hoy’s Draft Database, linked to in the opening). His defensive instincts continue to impress me every time I watch them. He’ll have games where he’ll switch onto a guard and block them at the rim (22 blocks at the rim), and then the next time down he reads a passing lane and starts the break (2.6 stocks, 2.1 fouls per game). He knows he can’t consistently stick with small guards on the dribble so he does a decent job mirroring and moving his feet quickly. Also another one of his skills is closing out, he blocked 8 3 pointers this year. He was the anchor of Cincinnati’s insane defense because he could do everything on that end of the floor. Also, it’s not like he was a slouch on offense. 43.5% from 3 on over an attempt and a half per game, 74% from the line, 43% on 2 pt jumpers with only 35% assisted. He’s an efficient shooter this season, he hasn’t been one his whole career but his jump shot looks good and now it’s a weapon. Post-up game is solid, most of his offensive possession involve posting up. Top 30 percentile, can abuse switches and smaller guys. I also love his passing, knows where and when to move the ball and does not turn it over, had an AST/TO ratio of 2.11.
<br><b>Negatives - </b>Will be 23.5 on draft day, always something to keep in mind if teams are aiming for a high ceiling guy. His length is fine but his frame raises some question marks, large torso but skinny arms. Slow jumper and only shoots if he has to, needs to be more confident because he can shoot. His lack of confidence makes me wonder if this season was just a flash in the pan, and his jumper isn’t really there yet (shot sub-30% last year). If he relies on banging down low with 4s and 5s in the NBA, he doesn’t have a place offensively because only shot 56% on non-dunk attempts at the rim. With that, he only shoots open 3s, and he’s not one to attack a closeout and make something happen. This might have something to do with his handle, it’s super poor to the degree that he loses the ball sometimes dribbling up court. Doesn’t make many passes where he creates a scoring opportunity, mostly just passes to open shooters or big men when doubled. Defensively, the only nitpick I can come up with is his feet, although he can stay with some smalls for periods of time his feet are kind of slow, so he relies on his instincts to block shots and reach for steals. Also, he loves getting those 3 point blocks so sometimes he gets super jump-happy on his closeouts. 
<br><b>Overall - </b>Going off of his senior season, Clark takes nothing off the table. There’s a few things he can do better (most notably keeping his jumper consistent) but there’s a reason why the stats are so high on him - he contributes to winning basketball and makes defensive plays more often than anyone else.

<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Kevin Knox, Kentucky - </span><br>
<b>Position - </b>Off-ball shooter from the forward position, but unclear who he guards defensively.
<br><b>Positives - </b>The two key NBA caliber qualities in Knox are his frame and his shooting. He’s lanky as hell, standing at 6’9 with a 7’0 wingspan. Only weighs 215 pounds, but he has wide shoulders and I’m confident he can fill out, bulk up, and look like an NBA wing. Next is his shooting. I really love his stroke and release, stays balanced and keeps his release super high. With that, he’s unafraid to shoot with a hand in his face because he knows no one is blocking him. Splits at 34% from 3 on 5.6 attempts per game with 77% from the line, which aren’t inspiring at first glance but coupled with his high size and confidence gives hope that he can be a true specialist one day. Demands a lot of gravity running around screens and requires a lot of defensive attention. 42% on 2pt jumpers, well above average especially for his size. Really comfortable getting to his pull-up. Has a “hot zone” from the right elbow extended, that’s his spot. Has a super consistent right-handed push/shot floater, a few times Cal ran plays for Knox to get to that shot when they needed a bucket. Definitely improved as the season went on, became Kentucky’s crunch time scorer for the SEC tournament and first few games of the tournament. Defense is pretty meh but his length is clearly his best asset, relatively quick feet to stay close to guys. Kentucky guys in the NBA usually show skills in the league that you don’t see much in college (Booker, Towns). One of the youngest guys in the class, will be younger than 19 on draft day. 
<br><b>Negatives - </b> Imagine doing anything on a basketball court besides shooting. Those are all negatives for Knox, and you could even argue shooting is a negative and I wouldn’t disagree. He’s supposed to be a shooter who barely hit 35% from 3 and is very inconsistent. Who does he defend at the next level? Can never get all the way to the basket and I think it’s just because he never wants to, almost wants to settle for some inefficient pull-ups. Not quick enough to guard 3s off the dribble and not big enough to guard 4s. Super low stock numbers, doesn’t make an impact on defense. Poor off-ball defense, really struggles with getting through picks, probably has to do with frame and strength but I also don’t think he’s locked in on that end. Some people like his athleticism package but he has never wowed me, no quick first step, relies on length to defend. 
<br><b>Overall - </b>If you think Knox is worth a first, you have to hope he shows marked improvement with his jumper along with becoming an above average defender. That’s a lot to hope for if you’re investing a high pick in him.
<br><b>Comparison - </b>You have to hope he’s <span id="big_board" class="comp">Otto Porter</span> and not <span id="big_board" class="comp">Jeff Green</span> offensively because he’s not bringing a lot of defensive value. I think he’s more Green.
<br><br>
<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Jevon Carter, WVU - </span><br>
<b>Position - </b>Excels as off-guard offensively and primary PG PoA defender.
<br><b>Positives - </b>Carter’s offensive skillset revolves around his shooting profile. ~86% from the line, 39% from 3. Is adept at getting his threes, whether it be a pull-up or off the catch. 39.6% on two point jumpers with only 15% assisted shows his improvement as a creator. Always keeps his dribble alive, very heady point guard who has improved at running the show. 11 assists per 100 possessions with an AST/TO ratio of 2.61 are huge upgrades over previous numbers, goes to show real progress being made on his game. Really became a true PG who initiated the offense after starting as more of a combo guard. Has some P&R upside I’ve seen, no high-level instincts but can be a tertiary or even secondary playmaker in the NBA, top 3 percentile according to Synergy. The two things that jump out about Carter’s defense is his consistent effort and physicality. I’ve never seen a guy who plays 35 minutes a game and maintains such a high level of effort. He face-guards and presses and bothers the opposing guards the entire game and never seems to get tired. Highest STL% of any NBA-caliber guard in the last 4 years. A lot of that is the system, sure, but he’s a really good defensive guard. He’s used to denying and jumping passing lanes, which I think can be useful to some teams in certain contexts. In more legitimate perimeter situations, his aggression is apparent. He stays stride-for-stride with his man, mirrors well, and uses his physicality and strength to keep his opponent off balance. Really good at getting a piece of ball when the offensive player is driving without fouling. Very aggressive when confronted with mandatory switches, can use his physicality to stay with bigger guys although definitely not ideal. Advanced stats love him, really impressive intersection of win shares and BPM. <a href="https://nbamath.com/2017-18-ncaa-tpa/">#1 in NBAMath’s total points added metric.</a>
<br><b>Negatives - </b>He’s only 6’1.5 with a 6’4 wingspan and although he’s got a strong frame it won’t be a deterrent for NBA guys. For comparison’s sake, Rozier has 6’8 wingspan to complement his 6’2 height. No penetration to his game, doesn’t attack closeouts whatsoever. Only 1/4th of his shots were at the rim, and barely shot above 50% when he got there. Bottom 2 percentile in finishing non-post-ups according to Synergy, that’s horrendously bad. I am also iffy on his floater, the touch doesn’t really seem to be there. I don’t love his handle, his go-to move is a between-the-legs cross to a step-back, but a lot of times he bobbles it. Although his defense is great, I’m worried he’s more of a steal defender than he is a straight lock-down guard defender, mostly because of his size. Has almost no flexibility because of his size, and even some PGs are just bigger than him. Also, Synergy doesn’t rate his defense well at all surprisingly. P&R and man-to-man defense is rated in the bottom half among NBA draft prospects, I don’t think this represents his actual ability but it is pretty interesting. Also, I had in my notes that his team defense wasn't always ideal and he would blow the occasional rotation but I think that may be by design. I didn't put which games or contexts these plays occured in, but I have to imagine it was Carter's job to prevent someone like Trae Young from scoring rather than Cam McGusty. 
<br><b>Overall - </b>Carter is a player whose overall skills are not superior to his counterparts but his archetype and lack of serious flaws separate him from the pack. There aren’t too many players who relish playing defense quite like him. I think he’d be a great fit with teams that have primary creators at other positions. 
<br><b>Comparison - </b>worse defensive <span id="big_board" class="comp">Patrick Beverley</span>
<br><br>
<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Devon Hall, Virginia - </span><br>
<b>Position - </b>Clear 3nD wing with + passing instincts. 
<br><b>Positives - </b>Ideal shooting profile, 89% from the line and 43% from 3. Has a sweet lefty release, not afraid to shoot with a hand in his face. Really useful pump fake, and quick with attacking right after.  Surprisingly adept at getting his shots up off the dribble, usually pulls off his left after a head fake. When he does attack downhill and goes towards the rim, loves to suck in the help D and make the drop pass to the big. Makes some relatively high level passes, can attack off pin-downs and throw lob passes or kick outs to shooters. Despite his strong passing acumen, he still manages to limit mistakes, 3:1 AST/TO ratio. When he doesn’t have the ball, he’s still a threat to hurt a team. Moves well without the basketball, sets screens, and quick to get into his shooting motion. Ran PG for Virginia for some stretches. With all that being said, his defense is very impressive as well. Hall was Virginia’s best and most consistent perimeter defender. Moves his feet so well, expert at flipping hips and riding with his man. But really strong team defense instincts, bumping the roll man, stunting, covering two guys, all of that is just instinctive for him. Really good at contesting shots, takes smart angles and does his best to change the shot attempt. Not as bad of an athlete as he’s made out to be, has some more burst than you’d expect.
<br><b>Negatives - </b>Gonna be 23 on a draft day with average measurables, 6'6 and a 6'8 wingspan. The one thing I’ve noticed about Hall is he is really lacking as an athlete. He moves his feet well and has good technique against college guys, but going up against the best of the NBA, technique can only get you so far. I’m worried that he won’t be as effective defensively. Outside of athleticism, he struggles mightily finishing in the lane in traffic, just kind of throws up shots. Knows he’s a below average finisher inside, especially with his right, so he uses his floater a lot with mixed results. His handle is average, very rarely is used to attack, just to create space in a stationary setting. Defensively, there are a few things I’ve noticed. Quickness is good in locked-in on-ball settings but moving off-ball and closeouts you can tell he’s lacking. If he can’t stay on his toes he’s more liable to get beaten. Gets jumpy on the perimeter, very quick to fall for ball fakes. I also don’t like his closeouts, seems eligible to get blown by. Doesn’t really record many counting stats for playing in such a vaunted defense. Finally, seems to die on on-ball screens, I’ve seen it open a lot of holes, but the other 4 guys on Virginia all cover enough that it’s never a big deal. But I’ve noticed it across multiple games and plays. I don’t know if it’s almost by design with Virginia’s hedging but it takes him a full second to get around a screen. He doesn’t avoid them, he goes into them and then tries to get around. A little strange, but could just be a small sample size. 
<br><b>Overall - </b>I really like Hall. He is one of the oldest prospects in this class and has some limitations but his skills really satisfy his archetype, and his archetype is very in demand. His quickness and length aren’t elite, but I think Hall has a good chance at making an impact on an NBA roster.

<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Kenrich Williams, TCU - </span><br>
<b>Position - </b>Modern 4 with some 3 point shooting upside, good team D but little switching capability.
<br><b>Positives - </b>The first thing to talk about with Kenrich is his feel. He’s just got a next-level combination of hand-eye coordination, decision making, and court awareness. Nearly 2:1 AST/TO ratio combined with great read & react movements and mindset. Keeps track of where all other nine players are. Has a lot of the fundamental technique stuff down, off-ball offensive movements, shooting off the hop, etc. His shooting progressed over the years, hit 39.5% from 3 from his senior season. Looked decisive in getting his shot, little hesitation. Has a little bit of bully ball to him, Dixon loved to get him post-up touches in offensive sets. From there, could pass out to open shooters on doubles or back down and finish in traffic. Really really good rebounder, a lot of it with him is technique. Strong physical box outs. One of his best skills. On defense does a fantastic job of locating the ball and his man, stays in position. A very active defender, with his rebounding mindset he’s always moving and especially boxing out big men if TCU’s big went to contest. Not many guys do that. Makes up for athleticism by always staying on his feet and keeping his base centered and legs wide so he can afford to react a little slower. Knows he can’t stick with good athletes when defending on-ball so he’s elite at mirroring, matches guys step for step. 
<br><b>Negatives - </b>His physicals are unimpressive at best, 6’7 with the same wingspan at 210 pounds and 23.6 years old on draft day. He’s older than Giannis. Type of frame that looks like it can add weight very easily. Super slow laterally, vertically he’s fine but almost a complete mess in terms of speed. Just has too much of his frame to move. Shooting is still a question mark, shot sub-70% from the line every season and his high before 68.8% this season was 60.7%. Very average finisher around the basket, 64% is almost exactly average for NBA caliber forwards, and half of those were assisted so it’s not like he’s making difficult drives and finishing in traffic. Favors a face-up midrange jumper, low-percentage shot. Doesn’t have the game to be a primary creator, at best a role player who plays off of others. Does not possessed a refined handle, one of his worse skills. His best skill is rebounding, which is fine but as an unathletic 6’7 forward how much value does that have? No shot he can grab boards against NBA bigs which means he can’t exist as a 5 so is strictly a 4. Defensively he has no chance of guarding smalls on switches or even in some P&R coverages which could make him a liability. 
<br><b>Overall - </b>TheStepien’s draft evaluation said it best - how far will basketball IQ take him? If you believe in the shot, you might be higher on him than I am, but outside of feeling the game I’m not sure he’s got too many NBA caliber skills.
<br><b>Comparison - </b>poor man’s <span id="big_board" class="comp">Boris Diaw</span>

<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Anfernee Simons, IMG Academy - </span><br>
<b>Position - </b>Primary self-creator with some passing chops, negative value perimeter defender, little to no switchability
<br><b>Positives - </b>Has all of the requisite skills to be considered a star one day. Impressive 6’9 wingspan. Clear self creator and scorer which is the key skill to become a superstar in the NBA. Great shooter who can pull it off the bounce or catch. Excels with the ball in his hands, can get whatever shots he wants no matter the competition. Quick release and quick trigger, can shoot no matter the contest which is a good sign. Catches the ball of the hop well, his footwork is pretty good for an 18 year old. Has a sort of shifty smoothness to him with the ball in his hands, and I always think that has some to do with confidence. Has a great floater and it’s his go-to shot in the paint. Prefers going right but not bad with his left. Has all the tools defensively, it’s just consistency and effort and awareness. Elite level vertical quickness offensively, defensively reacts quickly too but not on the same level.
<br><b>Negatives - </b>Lacking in size if he is a 2 at 6’3. Not playing college basketball obviously hurts his stock and gives him no experience playing against guys bigger and stronger than him, plus it's harder to get a clear evaluation on a high schooler. His frame will need a ton of work. It’s evident he hasn’t put too much effort into bulking up. His shot mechanics aren’t perfect, kind of loads it up too far in front of his face and can release low. Decision-making is poor, plays like he has never has been coached. Doesn’t know when to/when not to pass, sort of remarkable for a guard really. With that, shot selection is a question mark, finishing isn’t great but he clearly prefers jumpers than taking it all the way. Settles for a lot of floaters. Handle is solid but lacks the control to excel and use it as iso tool.   Has to learn how to give effort defensively because he’s not used to caring about that side of the ball.
<br><b>Overall - </b>I think the culture change from playing high school dudes will take a long time to get over. He’s used to monopolizing the ball whereas in the NBA he’ll just be one of the guys. Because of this, he’s a guy who won’t reach his potential until around his second contract, which means it will take years to reach return of investment. Has high upside as a primary self-creator which is one of the most in-demand archetypes but lot of question marks. I think so much of his draft stock is dependent on the team that drafts him, if they can commit a development program and are patient he can be a star.
<br><b>Comparison - </b>I’m struggling thinking of a great comparison but I’m going to go with <span id="big_board" class="comp">Jamal Crawford</span>. 
<br><br>
<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Omari Spellman, Villanova</span><br>
<b>Position - </b> Floor-spacing big. Defensively a 5, not much perimeter ability but high effort level.
<br><b>Positives - </b>Spellman is a big who excelled in Jay Wright’s open 5-out system, and will continue to excel with NBA spacing. Athletically, his best attribute is his vertical, which he uses to sky for block shots or power through traffic for dunks. As a freshman, Spellman shot 43% from 3 on almost 4 attempts per game, along with shooting almost 42% from the NBA line according to TheStepien’s shot chart. He is a consistent shooter who gets into his shot off the catch fluidly and never shies away from open shots. Has an effective post game and can score on bigs with a strong right hook.  Surprising upside as scorer considering his handle, less than 50% of his shots at the rim were assisted and less than 45% of his 2 point jumpers were assisted. Can attack closeouts well for a big man. Another thing you notice about Spellman is his offensive IQ. He’s sets strong screens and recognizes mismatches and exploits them. Has shown flashes of passing vision, hitting shooters on doubles or finding cutters. Defensively, Spellman always competes hard and gives a consistent effort, just like all other Villanova players do. Can draw charges. Most of his defense is built around that. Much maligned for his perimeter defense but when I have watched he’s never been a complete liability. High IQ and plus positioning, engaged effort, and potential shot blocking while trailing all help to mitigate these concerns. For a freshman, doesn’t mess up too many rotations. Post defense is solid because of his frame, really stays anchored and doesn’t give up ground. Active hands in P&R. 3 blocks and over 16 rebounds per 100 possessions due in large part to good timing and instincts along with vertical explosion. <a href="https://twitter.com/Mike_Schmitz/status/980259375381204992">NBA executives want guys from Nova for a reason</a>. 
<br><b>Negatives - </b>Going to be 21 years old on draft day which is ancient for a college freshman. On top of that, Spellman was one of the biggest underperformers at the Combine. He had the highest body fat percentage which is alarming because he sat out a full year at Villanova and should have been in the weight room. He disappointed with his measurements, standing 6’9 with a 7’2 wingspan, Finally, the athletic testing numbers were not kind to him outside of the vertical numbers, which were only average. Questions about his shooting ability, only shot 70% from the line. Not extremely efficient inside either, under 60% at the rim. Has a propensity to flare to the 3 point line when he should be cutting, probably due to Villanova’s system and spacing. His passing flashes were just that - flashes. 0.8 assists per game, AST/TO ratio of 0.75. Most of the flashes were in the free-flowing Combine scrimmages and it’s foolish to put any stock into those games. Poor feet on the perimeter, his clearest deficiency. Although I mentioned earlier that I don’t think they are as bad as some people make them out to be, there’s no doubt a good team can attack him consistently. Can sometimes spread himself too thin and pursue blocks he doesn’t have a chance to get leaving his man for an easy putback.
<br><b>Overall - </b>The appeal of Spellman revolves around his shooting ability, effort level, and IQ. There’s a good chance his slow feet and lackluster athletic ability doom him on the NBA level but I believe those are overrated concerns, and his IQ and effort give him a solid floor. I’ll bet on him to carve out a role somewhere.

<b>Position - </b>Capable off-guard offensively with scoring potential. Not great iso defender on guards but high effort level. 
<br><b>Positives - </b>Jay Wright called Divincenzo the Michael Jordan of Delaware for a reason. Explosive athlete, insane vertical off two feet, especially from a standstill. Has bursts of acceleration and quickness too, although not in the same way as his  The hero of the national title game with 31 points, Donte is a scorer first and foremost. He’s got the green light off the bench, shooting 40% from 3 on over 7 attempts per 40 minutes. Second-most 25+ foot 3s of any prospect in this class at 43, and shot nearly 41% on them. Seems to prefer shooting off the dribble, top 10 percentile in pull-up shooting according to Synergy, which is his honestly his go-to shot attempt. Not afraid to shoot with a hand in his face, about 38% from three on guarded catch-and-shoot jumpers if I’m understanding his Synergy numbers correctly. Isolation and end-of-clock scoring potential if he refines his handle. Attacks closeouts very well, usually moves the ball but can attack the basket where his numbers show he’s an above average finisher. Playing under Coach Wright has definitely improved his basketball IQ, AST% has went up significantly all three years and currently boasts an AST/TO ratio of 1.76. Really uses vertical athleticism as a rebounder in traffic, it’s impressive, just under 5 rebounds per game as 6’4 guard. His defense is all about activity, he never stops moving. Good at altering shots due to his leaping ability. Makes some great rotations and has the athletic profile to switch relatively well and the effort is always there. <a href="https://twitter.com/Mike_Schmitz/status/980259375381204992">NBA executives want guys from Nova for a reason</a>. 
<br><b>Negatives - </b>Consistency is the clear problem for DiVincenzo. Lacks great measurables for a wing, probably pigeon-holed as a shooting guard defensively at 6’4.5 with a 6’6 wingspan. Offensively really relies on his outside shot to score, and if that’s not falling he can hurt his team more than he can help. Not refined touch at rim despite finishing numbers. Cannot be a primary initiator because of his handle and decision-making. Limited in that respect, his handle means that anything outside of a simple downhill drive can end poorly. Decision-making is also a major question mark, forces some stupid passes in traffic and especially when going to the rim. Also, assist numbers probably inflated due to the efficiency of Nova’s offense, he would look completely different in another system. Zero chance he can be a point guard at the next level, for the reasons mentioned and his defense. Just not a good man-to-man defender, sometimes is too jumpy and gets blown by. Probably not quick enough to defend point guards so really a linear sort of defender, even with his effort. Takes bad and inefficient angles in pursuit. One of the premier off-ball defenders at consistently over-helping. Whether it be rotating one pass ahead or jumping for a rebound he has no chance on, Donte’s effort level can even be detrimental. Because of this, prone to ball-watch and lose track of his man on cuts or just spot-up shots. Likes to gamble for steals, taking him out of the play. He just lacks consistency defensively just like he does offensively. 
<br><b>Overall - </b>Divincenzo profiles as a microwave scorer offensively with defensive promise if he refines his technique and mental approach. I’m confident he can especially with a good coaching staff and development system but his size and length will make it hard for him to be a consistent contributor.

<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Vince Edwards, Purdue - </span><br>
<b>Position - </b>Spot-up shooter at the 3 or 4, tertiary creator, off-ball wing defender with potential switching skills. 
<br><b>Positives - </b>Long frame at 6’9 with a 7’0 wingspan. Evolved his game over the years at Purdue. Offensively, he has been very effective in spot-up and off-screen situations (99th percentile on spot-ups, his most used play type and 87th percentile off-screens as of January).  No doubt his most effective NBA tool is his shot but offers a few added skills. FT% of 83.3 and 3P% of 39.8 prove solid mechanics and fluid release. Has some craft when driving in a lot of ways, knows he will never blow by guys but he can finish over them on occasion. I’ve seen a few fadeaways/hook shots that originate from drives that fail this way. Moves super well without the ball, was in a great college system to maximize his talents and BBIQ. Willing passer at 3 assists per game and AST/TO ratio at 1.42. Not great numbers, but seems to make strong decisions with the ball without forcing. Defensively does a good job using size, length, and positioning to not get beat too often. High IQ helps him on that end. 
<br><b>Negatives - </b>Suffers athletically. Not great at getting to the rim as I’ve kind of mentioned nor is he great at scoring when he gets there. Lacks a quick and dynamic first step to even blow by college guys and struggles finishing with his left, so his recourse is either to pass out or throw up a wonky shot. Moreover, he seems to have racked up a lot of assists by having his drive cut off and throwing passes out to Carsen and Mathias. Not great at driving and kicking basically, some of his assists are due to being around a great offense and great shooters. Defensively is really slow laterally. In a pure iso situation cannot hang with NBA 3s and can’t really rebound with NBA 4s, so some question marks defensively. 22 years old on draft day, which is older than you’d like for a prospect.
<br><b>Overall - </b> I like Edwards a lot more than other guys do. He’s a long, high IQ player who can shoot and I think will find a role with an NBA team eventually. The question marks athletically are very real but I don’t think he’ll be too much of a net minus on the defensive end to invalidate his offensive skillset.

<br><br>
<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Khyri Thomas, Creighton - </span><br>
<b>Position - </b>Long athletic combo guard, excels off-ball. Defensive versatility with large frame.
<br><b>Positives - </b>The best way for me to put this is that Khyri Thomas passes the eye test.  6’4 with a 6’10.5 wingspan but looks even bigger than that. Strong athlete with good quick feet. Effective and efficient scorer at all 3 levels, 41% from 3, 44% on 2pt jumpers, and a remarkable 79% at the rim. Adept at attacking closeouts and getting easy baskets. Gets his legs underneath him when he shoots, really gets balanced. In a really good system at Creighton that undoubtedly helped his offensive game, really looked to push the ball in transition. No doubt that will be similar to how NBA offense is played. Has the feel to keep moving when spotting up in weak side corner, usually just flares or exchanges. Has some post-up juice when being guarded by points and smaller guards, not the most efficient stuff but he’s aggressive in commanding the ball in those situations which could open up opportunities for others off doubles/kick-outs. Not really a point but has learned how to make the simple pass and keep an offense moving. Secondary P&R playmaker.His general defensive package is appealing. His length with that 6’10 wingspan affects shooters, and he uses every bit of it. Strong closeouts. In iso contexts he’s very good at shielding towards baseline instead of middle and forcing tough angles. Usually those plays lead to difficult floaters or in-air cross court passes. Does this while guarding the other team’s best guard. Anticipates actions and movements on the floor really well, swipes for ball on drives with relatively good results and for the most part mirrors effectively. Understanding of team defense concepts, makes great team rotations and stunts and recovers when he has to. One of the best college players in that regard.
<br><b>Negatives - </b>Positionally, is he a 1 or a 2? I’m not someone who really cares about positions but he’s one of those guys whose size doesn’t fit his archetype. Often has plays where he’s not involved in the offense and he just stands in the corner watching. Not that big of a deal in a vacuum but it just seems like every other play is him uninvolved with an offense. Has no ability in a P&R, supremely inefficent in that area. Doesn’t cut. Finishing numbers are flukey, shot ~63% both his freshman and sophomore seasons. Doesn’t get to the line much at all, more of an auxiliary offensive player. Relies on others to score, 92% of his 3s are assisted. Only 0.75 points per possession as a self-creator according to Synergy, 142 possessions.  Rudimentary handler, definitely needs improvement. No elite moves. Not a high-level passer in the P&R or on the floor, really minimal playmaker for others. Pedestrian stock numbers as a supposed lock-down defender, doesn’t impact the game much that way. I do think his man-to-man reputation is a bit overrated.  I’ve seen him get beat a good portion of the time, usually due to his inability to muscle through picks, but sometimes he just gets beat off the dribble by taking bad positions and trying to body up when the offensive player already has him beat. Struggles getting through picks, does not always seem to locate the best path to navigate, just seems to get hung up on the screener’s body instead of anticipating and getting over/under, although is prone to close out too strong. Doesn’t give a whole lot of team help considering he has to guard the likes of Ponds, Brunson, etc. Just can’t leave those guys.
<br><b>Overall - </b>Khyri has no glaring flaws, but after diving into the film I do have some questions regarding his defensive reputation. He passes the eye test like I said, but after that you start to notice he might not be as good as he appears, especially cnsidering his lackluster creation abilities.

<b>Position - </b>True point guard fit with on or off-ball versatility. 
<br><b>Positives - </b>Impressive length for a point guard, 6’7.5 wingspan despite only being 6'1. NBA pedigree with his brother Jrue dominating for the Pelicans. Good athlete, has some burst to him and decent high-end speed. Efficient role increase from backup behind Ball/Alford to starter and number 1 option, along with really efficient scoring numbers. 83% from the line, 43% from the line. Can shoot off the dribble in a variety of situations, off the pick and roll, attacking a closeout, etc. Very simple and quick release, little wasted movement. Excels as a spot-up 3 point shooter, every year has graded as Excellent in those situations <a href="https://twitter.com/colezwicker/status/976187452414021632?s=12">according to Synergy</a>. 58% at the rim is below average but 90% of the shots are self-created so I’ll give him a pass, obviously very good at getting to the rim. Keep in mind these efficiency increases coincided with him taking on a greater creation burden and running PG. Not afraid to attack bigger guys, can finish with either hand, draws fouls. Just has one of the best scoring profiles in this draft. Just so heady with the ball, keeps the defender behind him, gets to his spots. Improved as a passer in the P&R, can create for self and others but mostly his self. Loves to split. I’ve noticed he’s a better passer when he drives, he moves the ball and makes the simple pass on the perimeter but when he drives he really has his head up to try to find a shooter. Quick hands defensively, one of the better guards in the class at getting his hands on the ball and impacting a drive. I like his effort level when he’s locked in, he really hustles and locks in when his team needs him to. Fights through screens, is aggressive, plays like he has a chip on his shoulder. This extends to off-ball defense, usually smart with positioning and rotating. 
<br><b>Negatives - </b>Usually I save this type of overarching thought for the “Overall” section but Holiday is just such an average point guard, and you can find a handful of those guys between the G-League and overseas. I don’t think Holiday brings enough to the table to really invest a high pick in. 6’1 isn’t great size for a PG and although his wingspan is fine, his overall size is average at best. His finishing is average for a point guard if he doesn’t draw fouls, he hunts contact so often that it ends up missing shots. Next, his passing. Although it’s improved, he turns the ball over a ton. Forces dumb passes often and also just loses the ball on drives/gets it stripped. 1.54 AST/TO ratio is below average for an on-guard. On the other side of the coin, sometimes drives inside and gets tunnel vision and misses open shooters. Just a very inconsistent passer. Lacks elite handle, it’s good and is a tool for him but with how often he turns it over it’s not that effective overall. His defense, although solid, is hard to get a consistent feel for. Sometimes he seems engaged and tough and hard-working but then he’ll mess up a simple read or get blown by on the perimeter. Stocks are very low, a concerning sign for his overall defensive feel of the game. Negative DBPM, doesn’t mean anything to me but it’s interesting. 
<br><b>Overall - </b>I like Holiday’s skillset. He’s a tough-nosed point guard who can shoot and mostly competes defensively. I just don’t think he is refined enough to invest a good amount of draft capital in him when similar players can be picked up off the scrap heap.

<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Gary Trent Jr., Duke - </span><br>
<b>Position - </b>On or off-ball pure shooter. 2-guard defender with little switching upside.
<br><b>Positives - </b>Good size for a wing at 6’6 with a 6’9 wingspan. NBA pedigree. He might be the best overall shooter in this class, 87.6% from the line and 40.2% from 3, 41% from the NBA line. His gravity was so important to this Duke team just because it prevented teams from doubling Bagley or Carter. That’s going to be his role in the NBA. Utilizes a great shot fake as well. Obviously lethal in C&S situations, top 15 percentile in adding off-ball value. Can shoot coming off curls and other action, usually from midrange in the flow of their offense but this will almost definitely apply to 3s as well with time. If the initial drive/action fails, comfortable using a stepback or pull-up jumper. Always looks to score in those situations, very aggressive in getting his shot. Had a positive net overall for Duke and just because of how important his shooting is. 
<br><b>Negatives - </b>Everything on a basketball court besides shooting is a weakness. He struggles creating his own shot off the dribble, he can do it with help from screens so I have to believe it’s due to handle more than just lack of quickness. Finishing numbers were average comparative to other guards but he has done nothing in that department to warrant belief in improvement. FTr is also low because he never really leaves the three point line. No left at all, kind of settles for this awkward righty floater when inside, contorts his body looking for bail-out foul calls. Struggles creating separation on drives because he’s a poor athlete, probably has something to do with it as well. AST% was criminally low this year 6.8% is the lowest of any wing in this class. I had in my notes “40% chance he’s never passed a basketball in his life.” Cole Zwicker thinks Duke defense is bad because of coaching but that Trent is involved in more defensive breakdowns/finger-pointing than any other starter. I believe it after rewatching some of the earlier games before moving to the zone, Trent does a ton of ball-watching while standing flat-footed. His defense amounts to standing around and lackadaisically “rotating” which almost always means his man becomes open when he fails to close out in time. Just doesn’t defend with ready feet. In man-to-man defensive situations doesn’t do a bad job mirroring he just isn’t athletic enough. Grades poorly according to <a href="https://www.thestepien.com/player-distribution-tool/">TheStepien’s Player Distribution tool.</a>
<br><b>Overall - </b>If he wasn’t a freshman playing on Duke no one would think he’s a one-and-done guy. If you want a shooter, take Trent. If you want someone who does legitimately anything else, look elsewhere. However, because Trent will absolutely have more chances at making the NBA than someone like Allonzo Trier, I have to expect he will be a better NBA player and/or stick around for longer.

<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Mo Wagner, Michigan - </span><br>
<b>Position - </b>Offensive big with diverse skillset, high defensive effort but no ideal matchup.
<br><b>Positives - </b>6’11.5 with a 9 foot standing reach. Lynchpin to the Michigan team as the won the B1G and made it to the championship game. Integral to their improved defense and their consistent offense. I love his mentality, kind of plays like Psycho T where he wants to fight everyone against him. Those kind of crazy competitors always impress teams with their tenacity. Possesses a ton of offensive skills. To start with his shooting, 39.4% from 3, 37.7% on 2pt jumpers with only 37.5% assisted on a solid repeatable shooting stroke. Projects as a stretch big man, plus those 2pt jumper splits show that he is comfortable shooting off the dribble, rare for a big man. Strong finisher at the rim, 79%, doesn’t rely on athleticism there it’s a strange combination of finesse and brute force. The offensive skill I like the most in him is his pump fake, he leverages that momentary hesitation and can attack closeouts really well for a big. His passing improved every year, was a complete non-passer but slowly improving. His defense has been heavily criticized this season but he’s gotten better as the season goes on, he tries really hard. He’s always talking, moving, watching. Couldn’t really afford to foul very often because Michigan needed him on the floor, so at the next level maybe he could be more aggressive. Athleticism is solid, his mobility and effort are his best defensive qualities, and that might be able to shore up a lot of holes.
<br><b>Negatives - </b> I’m going to buck the trend here and talk about his defense first because he is really bad on that end. For someone so mobile and strong I feel like he is scored on every single possession. I don’t have any Synergy defensive stats but man, every game I’ve watched he gets dominated in the post. His perimeter defense, even with his mobility, wasn’t nearly as good as it should be. He just gets blown by even when locked in, I have to think it’s a fundamental technique issue, it’s not like he has super high hips or anything. Block numbers are critically low, steal numbers are average for a big. Outside of the basic hedges/blitzes/switches that allow him to use his mobility as a factor, his defense is all types of terrible. Offensively, he can’t really be a short roll playmaker because of his poor passing ability. I think that could be a really good use for his athleticism and frame. 
<br><b>Overall - </b>He’s a versatile offensive big who is going to be a bad defender. That is clear. Even though I might seem more negative than positive, I like his defense+mentality and think he can be a real player.

<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Kevin Hervey, Texas Arlington - </span><br>
<b>Position - </b>Pick-and-pop stretch 4. 
<br><b>Positives - </b>6’8 with a 7’3.5 wingspan, size is a legitimate plus. Hervey’s had remarkable college production, Sun Belt POY as a junior and 20 points per game this year. All-time rebounds leader at UTA and second in scoring despite missing half of his sophomore year. Shooting profile is appealing at his size, 34% from 3, 81% from the line. Very clean, smooth release with no wasted movement and extreme confidence in his abilities. Has shown proclivity as shotmaker off the dribble, knows how to leverage his size to shoot over the top of the defense and can get into his shot with ease. More willing passer than the stats show, capable ball mover but a shot taker first and foremost. Good rebounder, over 2 offensive and 6 defensive rebounds per game, size and game plan are two main factors as to why. Defense can be good in time, has flashes of potential switchability. I’ve seen some positive man D moments, light feet and swallowing length, UTA trusted him to defend dynamic guards on occasion. Defensive IQ is good on-ball, smart sense of anticipation. Surprising steal numbers as a primary 4. 
<br><b>Negatives - </b>More of a theoretical player than a complete one. Doesn’t have that extremely high release, it’s not low by any means but with his wingspan it could be completely unblockable. Also, for a stretch 4 type you would hope he’d be more consistent. 34% on 7(!!!) attempts per game is a lot, 42% of his shot attempts, and he won’t be able to shoot at will at the next level. Plus, he really prefers jumpers over layups, prone to attack a closeout and pull-up from the elbow instead of using size at rim. Because of everything I just mentioned, along with his AST/TO ratio of 0.81 and inaccurate passes, I have questions about his overall offensive IQ. He has a rudimentary handle, very high and uptight dribble. Little slow to flick hips and ride with man on defense. Usually has quick feet but his closeouts don’t exhibit the same type of quickness. Doesn’t always contest shots with his hands up, seems to let jumpers flow by. Low block numbers considering his length and physical gifts. Super lazy off-ball, half the time watches plays go by in front of him without being checked in. I think it’s also vital to mention he had two ACL injuries, one in each knee. Watching him it’s not obvious outside of occasionally not getting into a stance on defense, which is more laziness than anything. Probably impacts his athleticism, average quickness/speed scores at the Combine along with an uninspiring vertical.
<br><b>Overall - </b>Hervey is an interesting prospect, but I think he requires improvement in a lot of areas to reach a floor of an NBA-caliber player. With that being said, his skills are intriguing, and I’d be more inclined to take a shot on a 6’8 athletic 4 with a 7’4 wingspan and floor-spacing potential than other lottery tickets.
<br><b>Comparison - </b><span id="big_board" class="comp">Dante Cunningham</span>
<br><br>
<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Rawle Alkins, Arizona - </span><br>
<b>Position - </b>Requisite 3&D wing with + passing.
<br><b>Positives - </b>The clear positive with Alkins is his frame. 6’4 with a 6’9 wingspan at 217 pounds. When you look at him, he looks the part of an NBA basketball player. Able to bulldoze guys at the college level.  He also has a solid baseline in all relevant categories for an NBA player. Solid foundational scoring profile -  36% from 3, 72.5% from the line, 64.6% at the rim. Good finisher there, can make 1 or 2 tough finishes in traffic through contact because of his physical profile and strength. He’s got solid passing instincts, can move the ball, create off the dribble, run some P&Rs with mostly solid results. Finished in the top 5% percentile of pick-and-roll passing, albeit in limited attempts. Has a super high-arcing floater which is an important skill to have. Defensively, he impresses both in on and off-ball contexts. On-ball, his combination of lateral agility moving his feet and his frame+wingspan make him a terror for opposing guards with a lot of possibility for switching in the flow of an NBA game. Off-ball, his instincts are fine, often knows the correct place to be when locked in, intuitive positionally.  
<br><b>Negatives - </b> Alkins should be so, so much better. His biggest knock in my mind is that helies a ton on strength to dominate college players. So many of his drives he just barrelled into the defense and that’s how he got an open look. Also, mentioned elsewhere that he has the type of frame that may gain weight easily. His net rating was a perfect 0, sort of impressive. His scoring profile, although solid, is unimpressive at best. I think it will take a few years for him to get used to the NBA line and add positive value off-ball. He shot 26% on 2 point jumpers, that doesn’t bring much hope in his shooting. On-ball, he has a lot of decision-making questions. He struggled using his left when finishing. He doesn’t have an effective pull-up (as evidenced by the 2 point jumper percentage) so he has to either get all the way to the basket or pass. His passing was rated well according to Synergy but when watching he just forced some bad drive and kick passes or got stripped, sometimes overpasses/forces the issue. The numbers back this up, as both his AST% and AST/TO ratio were below the average of an NBA caliber wing in their final collegiate season. On defense, from the games I’ve watched seems a step slow defensively/laterally to stay with people. His reputation is so much better than the actual product you get, when I see him he gets blown by and commits stupid fouls. Off-ball, he honestly sucks. He might know where to be on rotations but he’s never focused enough to be there. He gets caught ball-watching or over-helping constantly to the degree where I think there’s an argument he hurt his team more than Ayton. 
<br><b>Overall - </b>Has all of the requisite tools of a solid rotational NBA player but none of the IQ. There’s a good chance I’ve watched some of his worse games but man the dude leaves so much on the table. I think team D in general is more important than on-ball D and he has a lot to improve there, in addition to becoming a more valuable and consistent offensive player.

<br><br>
<span id="big_board" class="player_name">William McDowell-White, Baunach - </span><br>
<b>Position - </b>Big passing point guard capable of playing off-ball in time. 
<br><b>Positives - </b>WMW passing and vision is absurd. 39.6% assist percentage would be in the top 5 of NCAA true guard prospects these last 4 years.Good decision maker too, 2.85 AST/TO ratio despite having high P&R burden as solo offensive creator.  Grab-and-go transition mindset, passing in open floor is where he excels, almost always finds open man. Second in German Pro A in APG, and one thing you notice when watching is how bad his teammates are, he would easily be first in that category if they could hit shots. He’s able to throw cross-court one-handed passes over his head and land them in a shooter’s pocket and the shooter will hesitate or toss up a brick. His passing is without a doubt his best skill, and having a skill like that will make teammates want to play with him. His offensive IQ is top-notch, he is a true floor general and leader at age 20 for Baunach. His shooting is a question mark too but his release is very smooth and he is able to get to that shot off the dribble in the P&R. Good touch on floaters and midrange jumpers, 59.6% from 2-pt range. Connor Harr mentioned here it’s because he doesn’t get much lift with his legs, which I absolutely agree with. FT shooting is a good indicator of overall accuracy, and at 81% it shows consistent mechanics. The results are inefficient overall but it’s all about the process as we’ve learned these playoffs, and I think he will turn into a respectable shooter. Plus, his shooting could in time amplify his passing skillset. Very good at getting steals, 2.0 steals per game is second in the league. Jumps passing lanes, extends his IQ to the other side of the ball and has a rare sense of defensive anticipation. Knows where to be 95% of the time, his teammates usually let him down with help and switches. Besides some good rotations McDowell-White relies on his size at 6’5 to keep him competitive in iso settings and it works pretty well. 
<br><b>Negatives - </b>First major negative is his shooting. Despite solid mechanics he’s only shooting 28% from 3 on over 4 attempts per game. He’s not consistent from deep at all, and although he has to take some tough shots on a bad team the touch isn’t there. I can imagine his off-ball shooting would improve if he was in a different role, but 27% is still a really disparaging. Some people I follow are higher on his defense (once again Connor Harr) but to me it’s pretty clearly a negative. Outside of having good size for the position, he’s really lacking as an athlete and it manifests itself against good competition. His anticipation on that end is good, and that’s usually his saving grace, but he can’t really anticipate plays in a 1 on 1. If he bulks up he’ll improve but his quickness isn’t good, and he’d be a liability guarding in space against good guards. Another thing is his defensive engagement wanes, a lot of times he’ just biding his time until he plays on offense. He doesn’t complete his rotations, he doesn’t have strong effective closeouts, etc. I would hope this is because he needs to do so much offensively that he relaxes on defense, but who knows. Finally, German Pro A wasn’t exactly setting the world on fire, and McDowell-White’s team had the second-worst record in the league. I think the speed and athleticism of the NBA game is going to require a huge wake-up call for him. 
<br><b>Overall - </b>McDowell-White’s passing and IQ are top of the line in this class, and his size at the point guard position is a real strength. However, I don’t think he brings enough in those areas to make up for his mediocre shooting ability and defense. I’m intrigued by him, but I don’t think he’s worth a first round pick. 
<br><b>Comparison - </b>homeless man’s <span id="big_board" class="comp">Ricky Rubio</span>
<br><br>
<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Malik Newman, Kansas - </span><br>
<b>Position - </b>True shooting guard.
<br><b>Positives - </b>Newman is a prototypical shooting guard. Athletic wing who can shoot the ball, attack the rim, and defend a little. Not afraid of anyone or anything, someone who rises to the moment. Good lateral agility with quick feet. Strong frame, has definitely bulked up a ton since transferring. He has finally shown the shooting ability he should have - 83.5% from the line and 41.5% from 3. His midrange splits are great too, 38.8% on jumpers and only 16.1% assisted. Has shown the knack to be a great scorer off the dribble and that self-creation skill, (his self-creation score is rated very highly in my database) is supremely valuable. Has became much more comfortable shooting off the catch, along with an ability to attack closeouts and relocate to get open off-ball. Good finisher, could be better, but solid athlete to at least get to the basket. 59.8% at the rim is below average but only 25.7% assisted, that’s still above average as a self-finisher in my database. Defensively is a mixed bag, sometimes he plays hard and is engaged and shows that lateral movement ability but other times is just lost. <a href="http://www.nbadraft.net/players/malik-newman">NBADraftNet cites a strong work ethic and love for the game</a> which I believe is a very important aspect for player development. 
<br><b>Negatives - </b>Lacks ideal measurements for a wing, 6’3 with a 6’3.5 wingspan isn’t very good and I’m unsure how consistently he can guard PGs. Insane difference between his right wing shooting and his left wing shooting (75%ile difference), goes to show his inconsistency. I had in my notes he was good at drawing fouls but his FTs per 100 possessions and FTr are low. Never cuts, just stands behind the 3 point line waiting for the ball. Passing is very basic, never makes plays happen. Although he seems to be fine defensively in certain contexts, doesn’t really record any stocks. Barely over a steal per game? 0.2 blocks per game? With someone as athletic as he is these stats should be so much better. I read an article, I don’t remember from where, that said that it took Self until January to get Newman to start playing defense that Self thought was even decent. Is very prone to just watch plays happen, seems like he goes in and out of focus. Advanced stats don’t seem very kind to him, probably because he doesn’t do much other than shoot. Kansas was marginally worse with Newman on the floor, almost definitely a noisy stat, but I think a piece of the puzzle.
<br><b>Overall - </b>I like Malik Newman. I’m not sure if he’s a consistent NBA shooting guard with his defensive lapses and lack of instincts. But someone with his shooting and athletic ability? Who knows, drafting is a crapshoot. I still think I’d rather take someone who feels the game than someone who doesn’t.

<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Trevon Duval, Duke - </span><br>
<b>Position - </b>True playmaker and creator offensively with P&R ability. Guard defender with length enough to switch and lock in. 
<br><b>Positives - </b>Has all of the physical tools you could want from a point guard. Great passing instincts, can run an offense, has great athletic ability, can clamp up point of attack. Can utilize the P&R to get any shot he wants especially with his athletic burst. Able to blow by his guy and attack the basket in iso situations. Improved as the season went on as a shooter, still not a marksman by any means but felt confident enough to shoot shots when he was open. Speaking of, he’s very confident in himself. The type of player who at the college level could make some plays that I don’t think anyone else could. Whether it be jump a passing lane after a defensive rebound by the other team and convert an and-1 layup or burn by his man with an in-and-out dribble and finish over 3 guys with some acrobatics, he’s capable of legitimately anything on a basketball court. Defensively has all of the tools as well. Great length and uses it effectively, quick hands to pickpocket drivers, willingness to try hard and the competitiveness to go with it. Projects to be one of the better guard defenders with some technique refinement. Doesn’t let his previous mistakes get in his head and alter his decisions, just continues to plug away and never shies away from the moment.
<br><b>Negatives - </b>He is one of the worst draft prospects I can recall with his decision making on both ends. Highest turnover percentage of any drafted guard prospect the last 3 years. He just made some passes where you would think he learned how to play basketball a week ago. I’m talking like, would throw the ball out of bounce on a 3-on-1, or throw a rifle pass to Bagley that would fly over his shoulder. Defensively I mentioned the tools but holy shit someone with as good of an athletic profile as him shouldn’t be as bad as he was. Got blown by a ton. Reached for the stupidest of passes that he never had a chance at. Gave up a lot of and-1’s by committing stupid fouls. Some guys I play pick up with are smarter point guards than him it’s baffling. He also can’t shoot whatsoever. Shot under 60% from the line and under 30% from 3. Just really really bad, was a complete liability off the ball and no NBA team worth its salt would let him play on the ball. Stuck between a rock and a hard place. Mechanics are also poor, I’m no shot doctor but I don’t see that ever becoming a viable skill for him.
<br><b>Overall - </b>Duval fits as an athlete at the NBA level but other than that he isn’t an NBA caliber player. If he redefines his game and eliminates his current decision-making choices then maybe, but that’s ingrained in him, that’s just who he is. I would be surprised if he is a long time NBA player, but I guess it depends on coaching + system some too.

<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Grayson Allen, Duke - </span><br>
<b>Position - </b>Off-guard, tertiary creator, spot-up shooter, below average perimeter defender. 
<br><b>Positives - </b>Good shooter at 37% who was the lynchpin for Duke’s offense the last three years. Top 20 in OBPM. Great free throw shooter consistently, above 80% every year. Historic college player who showed improvement throughout his career, which makes me think he will only continue to improve at the next level. Has a quick release, one of those where you can tell he’s been working on it by not bringing it below his waist. A great shot fake to go with it. Went from a good athlete/hustle player with some skills his freshman year to a solid shooter and occasional creator, which to me shows his work ethic. Hit many tough shots. Decent athlete and an above average finisher, his floater has improved a lot too. Has a tiny bit of shiftiness when driving inside with eurosteps and off-footed stuff, not much but a little bit. Improved a ton as a passer as well, has an AST/TO ratio of above 2. He ran a lot of point for Duke this year and was pretty good at it. Led Duke in net rating, probably has a lot to do with their roster makeup honestly. Defensively has been his crux but he’s never been poor, just about average I would say. <br><b>Negatives - </b>
<br><b>Negatives - </b> Obviously had problems with attitude/aggression problems in college but I don’t think that will keep any team from drafting him. His shooting also seriously regressed as the season went on which is a huge red flag considering that’s his only NBA-ready skill. Shot 44.6% from 3 in non-conference play and fell to sub-30% in conference play. If he’s not shooting, he is bringing next to zero value to an NBA team. With the downturn in efficiency, his usage numbers have declined, so it’s not a workload problem. Although he’s a good finisher in the college game, I imagine he’ll struggle a mightily in that regard against NBA caliber length. Defensively is pretty bad but could be better with the right fit due to rather solid tools. Can’t really switch too much, 6’5 with a 6’7 wingspan is fine but not great. Used to be known as a great athlete but hasn’t really been showing it recently, definitely a below average athlete by NBA standards. More of a vertical jumper than a lateral mover, which is unarguably more important. Didn’t exactly learn the ideal defensive rotations from Coach K. Can be caught ball-watching instead of sticking to a shooter or boxing out. Not great guarding PoA. I don’t think it’s Grayson’s fault that Duke’s man D was horrific this year but it’s not like he was a defensive stalwart, and he was involved in a few of the (many) breakdowns. Grades confidently poorly according to <a href="https://www.thestepien.com/player-distribution-tool/">TheStepien’s Player Distribution tool.</a>
<br><b>Overall - </b>Not 100% sure I’d rather have Trent than Allen, but I don’t think I’m high on either. He probably wasn’t in the best situation this season but he has undoubtedly gotten worse this season. I had him as a first round guy going in but now I’ve soured. I find it hard to envision a path to an NBA roster if his shooting doesn’t improve. When he ends up on the Warriors or Celtics I’m prepared to give him a Chad Ford-esque bump up to top 25.

<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk, Kansas - </span><br>
<b>Position - </b>off-ball shooter from the wing position comfortable switching.
<br><b>Positives - </b>6’7.75 wing, great size. Going to be 21 on draft day which is young for a senior. Good vertical leaper, can get up higher than you’d expect. His NBA potential is almost solely due to his shooting. 44% from 3 and 80% from the line shows he’s a real, legitimate marksman. Shot 46% from NBA 3 point range, that’s in the 93rd percentile. Loves shooting from the corners/extended elbows. Not afraid to attack the rim and attack bigger guys, plays fearlessly. Great at getting the ball to the post and rotating it offensively. Really good at relocating off the ball. Shows good effort when he doesn’t have the ball, attacks the glass for offensive rebound opportunities. Defensively is a mixed bag, I laud his consistent effort. He always competes, can guard bigger guys for stretches just by being physical and trying to front. It’s not always pretty, but it shows determination. Pretty surprising defensive instincts, seems confident in his rotations and always is aware of ball and man. Has been playing professional basketball since he was 16 in Ukraine. 
<br><b>Negatives - </b>Basically a lot of his average skills in the college game are going to turn into weaknesses at the next level. Was last measured at a 6’6 wingspan… that’s pretty embarrassingly small, and definitely hurts his already limited defensive upside. 27.9% on 2 point jumpers is uh… less than stellar. I’m very confident he’ll be a poor finisher against NBA bodies with NBA length, only shot 52% at the rim this year with more than half of that being assisted. Worst finishing numbers in this class. He’ll be strictly a 3 point shooter if he wants to score. Can’t shoot off the dribble much, lacking as a handler. Has very little offensive game inside the arc, looks to pass in a drive and kick setting. He has no chance of being a creator, not even in a late-clock P&R. Finished in the 0.1 percentile as the ball handler in 74 possessions. That’s impressively bad. Very low stock numbers. Just cannot defend quicker guys around screens it’s just not his game .Seems like sometimes when defending P&R on the guard he kind of goes into the body of the pick setter instead of going around. Basically he just cannot defend guards, he’s more of a 4 than a 2. 
<br><b>Overall - </b>He’s a shooter, and that’s his NBA caliber skill. He does some other things relatively well, but really a team is going to draft him to come off screens and score and not because he is a moderately competent team defender. I’m a fan of prominent two-way guys, so I think I’d take a good number of other wings before Svi.

<br><b>Positives - </b>Robinson is on the court to score the basketball first and foremost. His shooting numbers are unconscionable. He’s scoring 24 per game in conference play on 44.5% from 3 and 66.6% TS. Comfortable shooting off the dribble or off-the-catch. Very good at relocating off-the-ball, finds open space and makes kick-out passes very easy for drive-and-kick passers (almost exclusively Bowman). He can score consistently from the free throw line against zones, he’s really lethal from there but only looks to score. Strong, effective stroke with no wasted movement. Never seems bothered by great contests, if anything looks to draw and-1s. I’ve seen him make some impressive passes off drives where he sucks in the defense and delivers the ball to the open man. Has some solid recognition skills when moving without the ball, keeps a head count of where defenders are and delivers the ball where it needs to go. His on-ball defense has impressed me, physical and aggressive. Doesn’t back down from a challenge, usually guarding the other team’s best perimeter guy. Even though his feel is sort of a question mark to me, really seems to be able to pinpoint what times he has to lock in defend and when he can float off a poor shooter. Against Duke, when covering Duval brings pretty smart help and plugs some gaps. Also, I have in my notes that he’s a better athlete than he looks, which I’ve realized is true in some respects but I think it’s because he moves like he’s the slowest guy on the floor. In actuality, BC would run lob plays for him on occasion, and he would get up and power down some tough dunks.
<br><b>Negatives - </b>Just a bit undersized for a wing at 6’5. Seems like he lacks that solid length to make up for it too but I’ll wait to see his Combine numbers. I think the main knock on him is his athleticism, which combined with his size makes it very tough to fall in love with a prospect. He’s just slow on the perimeter offensively and defensively, offensively has to settle for some very tough shots because he can’t explode past people off the dribble. On top of that, rarely seems to attack closeouts as far as I’ve seen, so he ends up shooting some very difficult shots. His shot selection can be dangerous, that’s the best way I can think to put it. Sometimes his shots can ruin the flow of the offense. Now, I mentioned passing as a plus because he can make some smart, heady passes but they’re so rare. He forces up a lot of difficult shots in traffic instead of finding the open guy, and other times just doesn’t even bother looking for teammates. Not really an effective P&R handler because of his lack of passing instincts, only looks to score. Never have seen him pinpoint the roll man. Overall, passing is definitely his last option offensively. I don’t love his handle either, fine for iso situations, provides him with just enough leeway to find a shot he’s capable of hitting, but can be taken away from him easily. Not NBA-level quite yet. Now, his defense. His on-ball defense is good, he’s aggressive yes, but I’ve seen him get challenged once. I don’t know if I’m watching the wrong games or BC game plans him to cover the other team’s least effective wing but he rarely does anything. Doesn’t seem to understand how to defend through action or movement, relies on instincts which aren’t useful. Another thing I’ve noticed, I don’t think I’ve ever seen him box out his man. I have seen him double on a big once (which his guy got a putback layup very easily) but other than that, he consistently watches the ball go up without any help. I came away really unimpressed with his defense as a whole. DBPM of -1.3 is very very bad, lowest of any NBA-caliber wing since Rashad Vaughn in 2015. 
<br><b>Overall - </b>Robinson scores the basketball really well but to me there are a lot of question marks outside of that. I don’t think he’s got the IQ, size, or athletic ability to be anything more than a bench scorer, and even that seems to be wishful thinking.

<br><br>
<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Ajdin Penava, Marshall - </span><br>
<b>Position - </b>6’9 big man with guard skills. Can fit in big and small lineups. Mixed strengths and weaknesses guarding 4s or 5s. 
<br><b>Positives - </b> Positionless big who can shoot, drive, pass, and defend. Mid-major sleeper coming from Marshall where he played in an NBA-ready, 5-out system for head coach Dan D’Antoni. Decent scoring ability, 34% from 3 on 1.7 3’s per 100 possessions, 42.6% on two point jumpers. I like, not love, his mechanics despite his slow release, it’s very fluid. Can attack off the dribble on a closeout, has a surprisingly useful handle, can become a tool. 73.7% around the rim, 89.7th percentile in finishing non-post-up’s, which shows a smart player who can make up for his length of strength and athleticism. I think his potential value comes from P&R decision-making. A very willing and capable passer, can make high-level passes to shooters, behind the back dump-off passes, has the whole arsenal. 96.8th percentile in passes to spot-up shooters as the roll man of a P&R, which I would imagine is part of his future value, but only has 7 possessions in that role. Comfortable rolling or popping depending on the situation, so he just reads how his man defends the P&R and adjusts accordingly. Likes to play some point forward, bring the ball up court. Was the fulcrum of Marshall’s defense due to his rim protection and mobility. Unbelievable shot blocker with a super long frame, averaging 7 blocks per 100 possessions, most in the NCAA! Even averages 1.7 steals per 100. Good closing speed on blocks at the rim, makes up a surprising amount of ground. Significantly improved his block to foul numbers, averages 7 blocks and 6 fouls per 100 possessions. Knows he can’t out-physical bigs when rebounding so he’s gotten better and smarter at tap-outs.
<br><b>Negatives - </b>Rail-thin frame at 200 pounds, desperately needs to add good muscle. Poor athlete, lacks dynamism in a big way. Severely lacking in high-end speed, idk how much of it is effort, like he just never runs 100%, but it’s weird to watch. First year shooting above 30% from 3, his shooting has always been questionable. Has a tendency to leave his shots really short. Despite his Synergy stats around the rim being so good, over 65% of those shots are assisted. Doesn’t seem like those shots are anything besides open dunks and layups. A lot of his offensive value is passing, because Synergy does not grade his shooting or post-up value very well at all, and even though he’s a good finisher you can find better guys if you just want a post finisher. Sometimes seems like he is more inclined to put up tough-layups on drives than he is to kick out to open shooters, which is strange considering he’s such a crafty passer. Rarely looks for shooters when he has the ball inside, it’s usually force a tough shot or a drop-down pass to the other big. Forces some difficult passes in much the same way, behind-the-back, around his defender, etc. Also, if he’s not involved in a P&R he tends to float on the 3 point line, doesn’t really cut or screen off-ball. Not a strong rebounder, probably more because of physical stature than anything. Stands flat-footed way too often defensively, if he’s not expecting a drive when defending on the perimeter or whatnot he just gets blown by like no other. Not great with verticality though, either a block or a foul. In <a href="https://youtu.be/iH8dp1BHOVE?t=10m27s">this video</a> he noticed that he only uses his right hand when blocking shots, just really weird. 
<br><b>Overall - </b>Penava offers a unique skillset. I used to think his archetype of active bigs who can stretch the floor, protect the rim, and attack a defense on short rolls but that is more theoretical than anything else. I’m not sold on his ability to do any of those things effectively enough to warrant a draft pick. 
<br><b>Comparison - </b><span id="big_board" class="comp">Terrence Jones</span>, who was more athletic and built than Penava and still failed. 
<br><br>
<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Allonzo Trier, Arizona - </span><br>
<b>Position - </b>Typical “shooting guard” with some functionality on/off-ball. Bad guard defender with little switchability. 
<br><b>Positives - </b>Measured at 6’5 with a 6’7 wingspan at the Combine, surprising numbers for him and solid for a shooting guard. Unbelievably gifted college scorer, averaged ~15 points per game every year. Excels at creating and scoring with the ball in his hands. Has a knack for hitting big shots. Synergy stats rate him superbly (top 10%) in a ton of offensive self-creation statistics, which shows that his offense is on the verge of being historic. My own self-creation metric has him as the second best creator of the past 4 years, behind only Jalen Brunson. Shooting 45% from NBA range according to TheStepien’s shot chart so moving to the further line shouldn’t be a problem. Great touch around the basket with floaters and other off-putting shots, makes up for the athletic deficiencies. Has some plus passing ability, doesn’t project to be a primary creator but he’s willing to move the ball for a good shot. He’s definitely improved as a driver looking for the pass, still not his first instinct but he can make a few nice kick outs and get guys open looks. Plays hard offensively, aggressive, really hunts his shot, isn’t shy about shooting. Quick hands on/off-ball, one of the better guys at stunting towards a driver and impacting the play somehow. IQ is pretty decent off-ball only when really engaged, can cover two guys, rotate in a team construct.  Has the highest plus-minus and net rating on the team, so he was the player most conducive to winning basketball, not Alkins or Ayton. 
<br><b>Negatives - </b>Most of the offensive negatives are just me nitpicking, but I’ll do it regardless. Never cuts, even when he should, but he’s such a great shooter it makes sense. Prefers deep 3s to ones that make more sense, a lot of times when drifting along the top of the key he’s like 5 feet behind the line. Struggles creating separation on drives so has to settle for some rough passes and waste shot clock or take tough shots when smothered. Finally, the most important negative on offense to me is shot selection, I’ve seen multiple games where he’ll pull up for 3 or jumpers in 1v1, 1v2, even 1v3 situations. That stuff will not fly in the NBA level. In general his athleticism is poor, doesn’t bring anything to the table in that regard. Slow-footed. Defensively is pretty bad in totality. He is prone to ball-watch and lose his man. He’s never really engaged, just kind of floats through plays, and gets burned often in myriad ways. The other team makes 1 or 2 passes and he just stops. On-ball isn’t any better but he’s more locked in with the ball in front of him. 
<br><b>Overall - </b>He has one of the top 5 best offensive players in this class, and that alone should be enough to translate. He needs to fix his defensive attitude and improve at shooting off the catch consistently but the advanced numbers are super kind to him. You have to bank on his defensive effort improving in a smaller role. However, similar to what I mentioned for Trent, I don't think Trier will get the same number of opportunities as some other simiilarly skilled players, which is why I have to rank him lower.
<br><b>Comparison - </b>Maybe a little <span id="big_board" class="comp">Marshon Brooks</span> without the same type of athletic explosion? Maybe </span>Malik Monk</span>, who had similar problems understanding team D concepts in Charlotte and has sat the bench?
<br><br>
<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Goga Bitadze, Mega Bemax - </span><br>
<b>Position - </b>True center prospect.
<br><b>Positives - </b>6’11 with a 7’2 wingspan at 250 pounds. Really uses his size, is very physical for stretches and competes. Plays like a true big man, can finish inside, protect the basket, and rebound. Consistent shooter from midrange, loves taking the shot and has a nice set shot with a good release, albeit a bit low. Potential to expand that shot to 3 point range. Nice footwork in the post, not always able to go through guys but can go around them with some up-fakes. Uses floaters more than any big man I’ve ever seen, his touch around the basket is strong and he is very comfortable taking that shot. More of a feel type of roller, finds space and moves to it. In that sense, knows where to go and where to be on the offensive side of the court. I like his offensive feel because he is also capable of making simple reads and getting the ball where it needs to be off of doubles and poor rotations. Strong recovery instincts when hunting blocks and protecting the rim. Very rarely gets beat in a 1v1 in the post. Active on the glass, good motor to keep plays alive. Young at 18, plays in the Adriatic League, which has cultivated young talent before.
<br><b>Negatives - </b>Despite his impressive touch is only shooting 66% from the line this season. Makes me wonder about his shooting. Speaking of, seems iffy on his shooting, has 3 point range but occasionally passes out of those shots. And if he pops on them instead of rolls, that kills the offense because a strong P&R goes nowhere and the offense resets. If he doesn’t shoot, he just pauses, contemplates shooting, and waits for his man to get back to him before swinging to other side. If he’s not going to shoot, he should just immediately pull into the next P&R and get a mismatch that way. Basically, he has to roll or quit being indecisive. I haven’t been too impressed with him as the roll man, not someone who projects as a dynamic finisher/athlete, almost entirely finesse. Lacks that quick passing ability off the roll. Struggles finishing through contact if he can’t dunk it, fails to make plays in the aforementioned 4 on 3 scenario. Needs to refine perimeter defensive technique to even be bad, right now has potential to be atrocious in those situations. Just has zero quickness when defending, it’s bad. Same with his reactions, just a tick slow. Therefore, can only play in a drop P&R scheme, which is a tough ask for a defense to be so linear in that sort of way. Foul-happy. I can envision him being bad at defending floor-spacing 5s just because he’s too invested in defending the rim, similar to Brandon McCoy. 
<br><b>Overall - </b>I think the NBA is moving away from bigs like Bitadze. Big physical guys who aren’t super smart and rely on their strength and size aren’t as in demand as they were 15 years ago. I think his type of positional archetype is not currently ideal for the NBA, and his skillset isn’t strong enough to mitigate that. 
<br><b>Comparison - </b><span id="big_board" class="comp">Vitor Faverani</span>
<br><br>
<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Tony Carr, Penn State - </span><br>
<b>Position - </b>On or off-ball shooter, Defends 1s, 2s, some 3s due to length but little PoA ability or +instincts
<br><b>Positives - </b>Exact numbers differ but somewhere in the neighborhood of 6’4.5 with a 6’8 wingspan which is great for a guard. Much improved three point shooter, improved average from 32% to 43% his sophomore season.  Confident shooting off the bounce which is an improved trait. Super high arc with high release, effective in getting to his pull-up. Top 20% in Synergy in guarded and unguarded catch-and-shoot situations. Super effective post up game on smaller guards, that was his entire offense last season, plays like a bulldog with his back to the basket. Uses it on smaller point guards and even some similar sized guards. Has the burden of creation on him in the offense (29% USG) so I understand why his efficiency is down to a degree comparatively. Solid rotational defender, knows how to use his length to disrupt.
<br><b>Negatives - </b>Thin frame, will not bury him as a player but limits some of his defensive upside. Not an efficient scorer, his finishing at the rim is horrid and his TS% of 52.7% is lower than almost all NBA caliber guards. As a 6’4 athletic on-guard he should be shooting better than 46.7% at the rim on 26.8% assisted, 6.4 percentile in finishing non post up situations. Lacks athletic burst and doesn’t have the same length explosion extension that someone like SGA uses. That is a legitimate problem there. Has an ugly shot which seems sluggish really the best way I can describe things. Kind of jumps forward on it instead of up-and-down. Slow release as well. Passing is good but isn’t great. Can’t manipulate a defense and make super high-level reads but does a good job. Defensively he should be so much better but it’s very rare for him to make an impact on a play. Low stock numbers, his team defense is okay over increments but never really wows me. 
<br><b>Overall - </b>Am I crazy for thinking that you can find so many similar players between the G-League and overseas? He’s just a bigger guard who can shoot, and although his passing is solid, I think that he is an expendable player. If he makes it long term in the NBA it will be as a consistent knockdown shooter and improved defender. Consider me skeptical.

<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Devonte Graham, Kansas - </span>
<b>Position - </b>Morphed into a true point guard.
<br><b>Positives - </b>6’6 wingspan impressed me, solid wingspan may make up for below average height. Insane minutes load, dude has been a consistently great player and played almost 1500 minutes. Graham’s offense is predicated on his jump shot, 40% from 3, 83% from the line. Consistently punished guards who went under on his screens, only 60% of his 3s were assisted. He has a good creation profile, as a playmaker for others or himself. 6th in assists per game at 7.2 with a 2.6 AST/TO ratio, capable of running the show and finding others. Top 2 percentile in the P&R as a ball handler, including top percentile in P&R passes to spot-up shooters. That’s a skill that will absolutely translate to the next level. Very tight reliable handle, always controls the pace of the game even when someone like Carter is guarding him. Really exhibits the qualities of a true PG despite playing off-ball last season. Pretty good at drawing fouls, FTr is above average for NBA-caliber guards but nothing elite. Absolutely insane unassisted creation burden, only 5% of his midrange jumpers and 4% of his shots at the rim were assisted. His defense is good in some contexts, high IQ for the most part to not get beat. Doesn’t take much off the table outside of size. I’m gonna say so because this is a short scouting report. Dude is a stone cold killer in clutch situations, probably one of the 3 best players in the country with under a minute left on the clock. Was dominant in the Big XII tourney and single-handedly beat Texas Tech to clinch the regular season crown. Insanely high net rating that is the second highest in the NCAA - Kansas is .34 points  per possession better with him on the floor. 
<br><b>Negatives - </b> Super old at age 23 on draft day. His athletic ability is uninspiring, along with his general size at 6’1. Really needs to be a knockdown shooter and passer to be a long-term fit in the NBA but I’m worried there’s so many guys with that size and archetype combination. He’s great in both areas don’t get me wrong but I’m unsure if it’s enough to mitigate some of the defensive deficiencies I’ll soon mention. First, offensively, Graham is shooting 44% at the rim. That’s good for 3rd percentile, which is horrid and you have to think that number gets even worse in the pros. He just struggles finishing against length a lot, and because he knows this, he tries to draw fouls often. It works in college courtesy of some questionable calls but this will never be a strength for him. On the defensive side of the ball he almost exclusively has to guard points, which is the hardest position to cover consistently. He sits down too much in his stance, not ready to move his feet, reaches when should be staying in front of his man. Low stock numbers, safe to say he’s not a defensive ace. 27th percentile in guarding a P&R ball handler, not great numbers for something he projects to have to do every possession. What I’m thinking is any switch is a mismatch that can be abused by a smart team. Although he is fine defending in college all of these weaknesses will be amplified in the NBA game and he will struggle greatly. With other guys like Carter, Thomas, and even Holiday they don’t hurt you in the same way defensively while bringing similar offensive capabilities. 
<br><b>Overall - </b>Despite his clutch scoring and winning pedigree at Kansas, Graham projects as a below average backup NBA point guard who lacks the dynamism that made Frank Mason a legitimate prospect last year. Overall, I’m not sure if his creation abilities are good enough to surpass true two-way guards in this class.
<br><b>Comparison - </b><span id="big_board" class="comp">Quinn Cook</span>
<br><br>
<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Dzanan Musa, Cedevita Zagreb - </span><br>
<b>Position - </b>6’9 wing with on or off-ball skills. Little defensive ability, no versatility, will have to be hidden. 
<br><b>Positives - </b> To start with his frame, a 6’9 18 year old wing prospect gives him a great size advantage as compared to his peers. His shooting has the potential to be great, he is a score-first wing who does not lack confidence. Shooting >75% at the line which shows reliable and consistent mechanics. You have to hope his shooting percentage numbers will improve over time because he’s got a ton of ancillary shooting skills with it. He can shoot it off screens, off the dribble going left or right, with deep range, deep range, everything you could want in a shooting profile. Can get to the basket on the back of his shot fake by attacking closeouts, and from there isn’t afraid of finishing through the trees. Not an extremely good finisher but knows how to leverage his length and shooting ability. If no room to attack, comfortable in midrange too between floaters and pull-ups. Has a reliable handle too, won’t kill a defense in an iso setting but can create his shot with ease. Left-handed hesitation dribble is his go-to move, shows a very surprising amount of explosion. Because of his handle has ran a good number of P&Rs with mixed results. Doesn’t exactly look to pass, ideally looks for his own shot, but occasionally reads doubles and hits roll man. We’ll surely get to his defense in a little bit, but I’ve noticed a few positives. Not always lacking as a team defender, can read some rotations well and react. Knows to bump the roll man, when to cover two, how to effectively watch ball and man. He doesn’t always do these things, but at least he has shown the IQ is there. 
<br><b>Negatives - </b>Wingspan is shorter than his height, at 6’8.5 not a huge deal by any means but still a negative. Very weak upper body, as expected for an 18 year old kid so that should improve as well. Here’s the real kicker - only shooting 32.6% on limited attempts between La Liga/Eurocup. He’s a supposed knockdown shooter with all of these skills shooting 32.6%. How is that supposed to inspire confidence? I understand his room for growth is immense but if the guy’s not shooting 40% from 3 consistently in the NBA he’ll be out of the league considering how bad he is defensively. With that, his shot selection is poor, takes some really ill-advised shots, also something I don’t think would go over very well in the NBA. I touched on his passing earlier but it’s more of a negative than a positive just because it’s not his first instinct. Next, his defense. It’s atrocious. Just watch this clip - he looks like he’s never played basketball before. Although that is the worst clip of his defense, it stands out as consistently bad. His lack of quickness on the perimeter manifests itself constantly, which is strange because he shows some burst on offense. #DraftTwitter people are higher on the idea of his defense really, his lateral quickness is there but he gets blown by often due to a combination of poor posture and technique.  I’m sure he’ll be a net negative on defense in the NBA, maybe even a top 5 worst defender. 
<br><b>Overall - </b>I don’t get any of the Musa love. I’m low on Knox but I’d clearly prefer him over Musa. I feel like his game is more suited to an on-ball role in a bench unit where he is the focal point of an offense, and where his “supposed” gravity becomes a weapon. Even with this in mind, there are too many major question marks for me to want to invest a first round pick in him. 
<br><b>Comparison - </b>taller and worse <span id="big_board" class="comp">Will Barton</span>

<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Brandon McCoy, UNLV - </span><br>
<b>Position - </b>True center prospect. Needs to cover other bigs to be effective, no perimeter defense skills. Good rim protection instincts.
<br><b>Positives - </b>7’0 with a 9'3 standing reach. True center size. Solid athlete for his size, not a lumbering sort of 7-footer. Comfortable taking and making a midrange jumper off a face-up but it’s not really his game. 72.5% from the line shows relative touch. Good vertical motion with his shot. Aggressive and strong offensively with remnants of a post game. Good hands to catch in traffic, loves the spin move in the post. Willing to use both hands, from what I’ve seen even prefers his left. His assist numbers are low but I’ve seen him make some decent passes out of the post. Regardless, he’s got two foundational skills his game is built upon: rebounding and shot-blocking. Averages 14.4 rebounds per 40 minutes, including 4.3 offensive rebounds.  Love his activity on the boards, very active, fights hard and with his frame, usually works out. 64 putbacks this season. His shot-blocking instincts are great, 2.5 blocks/40, does it without fouling. Knows when to stay vertical, when to use his body, and when to bring his hands down. 
<br><b>Negatives - </b>Doesn’t have much of a creation burden, over 70% of his shots are assisted, and he’s still not an efficient scorer. Settles for jumpers a lot, way more than he should. Poor screen setter, a very important quality for bigs. His handle is poor, he fumbles the ball on simple post-up dribbles and similar plays where he has to handle.  Horrid AST/TO ratio, 5 times more likely to turn the ball over than get an assist. No defensive IQ, like he’s one of those big men who tries to draw charges and stand still instead of contesting it’s mind-boggling, I’ve questioned his aggressive as a rim protector, he seems content to let guys score at the cup on occasion. Sometimes over helps. Doesn’t seem to be mobile, UNLV had him sag off any stretch 5s to protect the paint. His activity/focus lovel is hit-or-miss, a lot of times depends on play context, wavers in engagement. Poor acceleration, takes him a long time to move his feet back and forth in short sprints. Stands very flat-footed when “guarding” the 5 on the perimeter and P&R coverages. I haven’t seen this too often but I am confident small guards will be able to blow by/cross him when he drops. 
<br><b>Overall - </b>With his size, he will have a career as a professional basketball player. It won’t be in the NBA, but he can be useful somewhere. He’d be a lottery pick if he was drafted 20 years earlier.
