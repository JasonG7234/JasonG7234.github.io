<h3 style="color: #000;">Philosophy - </h3><br>
<ul>
<li>Value ceiling > floor for lottery selections and end of draft/undrafted guys. Other than the two poles, I value consistent high floor guys who don’t require a ton of developmental resources (coaching focus/system, G-League time, etc.) to reach their peaks.</li>
<li>Emphasis on wings > bigs > guards. You can find so many rotation caliber guards between the G-League and overseas, and also so many go undrafted. Bigs are similar, not quite the same level of production, but guys like Udoh/Birch went overseas, improved their games, and have made a moderate impact as bench bigs. I think wings in that sense are more rare, and therefore more valuable</li>
<li>In general I like two-way guys who can play in some different lineups and don’t project as liabilities. Basically guys who can play in crunch time and/or playoff games.</li>
<li>I understand the tier format doesn't make sense because there is nearly zero chance so many guys make it long term as role players, but it makes sense to me how to envision player skills and archetypes.</li>
<li>Also I know these comparisons suck and it’s bad to compare players and yadda yadda yadda but I think they’re fun so that’s all that matters.</li>
</ul> 
Player Evaluations are loosely formatted in the order of - <br>Physicals (Frame, Athleticism), Offense (Scoring (Shooting, Finishing), Passing, IQ), Defense (Man, Team), Mentality/Intangibles<br>

<br><br>
<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Zhaire Smith, Texas Tech - </span><br>
<b>Position - </b>6’5 forward/big man who can rim run and grab boards with potential 3 point upside. Game-changing defensive potential, switch 1-5 with rim protection.
<br><b>Positives - </b>6’5 with a 6’10 wingspan. I think he’s the best athlete in the draft, his vertical athleticism is absolutely bonkers and he’s really damn quick on the perimeter as well. He skies for rebounds and dunks to the point where it doesn’t even look human. Shooting is his swing skill, but still shot 45% from 3. Mechanics look solid, doesn’t shoot it too much for me to really get a firm grasp of where he needs to improve. Has a lot of lateral explosion, can blow by people off the dribble, although that’s rare. Always looking for something to do on offense, never stands around. Puts a ton of pressure on the defense on the defense that way. Hustles his ass off every play, he sets screens, cuts, rim runs, attacks the glass, etc. Regarding screens, in offensive breakdowns he loves to sets down and flare screens and get guys open, I mean what other freshman does that? He actually has unbelievable feel for the game, it’s not hyperbole. He reads shot attempts for offensive rebounds, looks for cutters when he has the ball. His defense is really damn good and consistent. He’s versatile enough to guard everyone 1-5, spent time on everyone from Trae Young to Azubuike. Loves to defend bigs, is very active and physical with them. Can stick with guards in PoA situations, ideal mirroring technique, and if he gets blown by can still make up for it with a trail block. So active defensively as well off-ball, seems like with time can become the ideal team defender. He even adds a lot of rim protection, 27 at rim blocks this season, insane for a 6’5 wing. It’s so rare to see a guy who is a crazy athlete, has the IQ+feel, and is active and always uses these gifts. He is a rare breed defensively. Advanced stats love him too, BPM of 11.8 (3rd among wings in this class) and high win shares. Grades well according to <a href="https://www.thestepien.com/player-distribution-tool/">TheStepien’s Player Distribution tool</a> with a high floor. 
<br><b>Negatives - </b>My worry with him is that he’s a 6’5 center. He has little functional offensive skill with the ball in his hands besides passing. His handle in traffic is poor, his off the dribble shooting is nearly nonexistent, and he has little confidence in his shot. He should have returned to school and worked entirely on his jumper and every aspect that comes with it. Low usage, isn’t a primary or even secondary option offensively and doesn’t project to be one. Shoots sub-50% at the rim on non-dunk attempts, which is a pretty low number until you remember everything near the basket for him is a layup. Perimeter D definitely needs refinement with technique. Sometimes is heavy-footed, sometimes is too jumpy. Occasionally doesn’t use the screen to his advantage and force the guard into it defensively. Although that should improve, no promises. Better at on ball D when defending dribble penetration, but if his guy catches and is in triple threat he’s more liable to be blown by off first step. 
<br><b>Overall - </b>Zhaire is a super difficult player to evaluate. I can’t remember a prospect with his skillset and frame. I’m not sold the 3 point shooting ever truly gets there but even without it his defensive potential is immense, he checks legitimately every other box. The number of people who can comfortably do everything on the defensive end are so few. He’s got that ability, and he’s worth a top 15 pick.

<hr id="big_board" class="tier_break">
<br>
<span id="big_board" class="tier_text">Tier 4 - relatively good chance @ above-average starter impact</span>
<br><br>
<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Jalen Brunson, Villanova - </span><br>
<b>Position - </b>On-guard creator, off-ball talent as a shooter and ball mover, PG defender projects to be below average.
<br><b>Positives - </b>Upperclassmen and unequivocal leader for Villanova, won 2 championships in 3 seasons. Unbelievable offensive talent, historically efficient at everything he was asked to do. His scoring and self-creation numbers are insane. He has the single highest offensive self-creation of anyone in my database, the first dude to hit 100. Splits at 52.1/40.8/80.2, 63.5% TS, 51.5% on 2 pt jumpers with only 3.4% of those being assisted, above 70% at the rim with only 20% of that being assisted... dude's next level. He is up there with Buddy and Jimmer as best offensive talents the last few years in college basketball. His post-up game is legit, can punish smaller guards on him and is actually efficient with his little step-back he has. Has a lefty floater he uses a ton if he can’t get all the way to the rim. He also exhibits total control when handling the ball, always plays two steps ahead (ie drive then headfake opens up interior pass). He’s gifted in the PnR, creates for himself and others, and rarely makes mistakes. Just always in control. I think he is the best offensive player in this draft, better than Ayton and Doncic. Defensively is mostly a negative but to me half of defense at the NBA level is effort, and he gives it. He hustles more than most, even with his offensive burden. His IQ manifests itself in this regard too, doesn’t really make mistakes. I think his strength is key on this end and even makes up for his lack of athleticism & length in some regards. Also, keep in mind <a href="https://twitter.com/Mike_Schmitz/status/980259375381204992">NBA executives want guys from Nova</a> for a reason. They’re hard-working, fundamentally sound, and tough as hell. Brunson is no exception.  
<br><b>Negatives - </b>I’m going to be nitpicking here. 6’2 with a 6’3.5 wingspan is not good for an NBA player. Offensively the only question marks are the consistency of his catch-and-shoot numbers and his post game. Last season he was in the bottom half of C&S numbers which means that facet of his game could be a tiny bit flukey. His post up game was good but against college guards, and NBA provides different monsters. Probably won’t be a plus, at least for a few years. Shot 37% from 3 from NBA range which is solid but not as extraordinary as you’d expect (you can really tell I’m digging deep here). Plus, his game is a lot of in-between stuff, mid-range jumpers and floaters that don’t exactly have a place in the current NBA. Doesn’t have the highest net rating on the team, that’s Bridges, which probably has more to do with their lack of wings than anything else. Finally, defense. His length is a big question mark here, he’ll have to almost exclusively guard PGs, of which there are so many great ones who could torch him. He’s going to be a negative on that end, which isn’t crazily detrimental to a team but could make the difference between a starter and a high-end backup. PG is one of the easiest positions to find good replacements for overseas, so if you’re drafting him you have to hope he’s starter quality. 
<br><b>Overall - </b>To me his positives are so much more important than the negatives. He’ll be one of the better offensive players in the NBA as a rookie, with no significant flaws on that end of the floor. He’s a high character guy who works his ass off consistently. I think he can be a starter. 
<br><b>Comparison - </b><span id="big_board" class="comp">Jameer Nelson</span>
<br><br>
<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Collin Sexton, Alabama - </span><br>
<b>Position - </b>Athletic on-guard with creation and PnR upside. Potential PoA defender who competes. 
<br><b>Positives - </b>6’7 wingspan. Does a lot of things very well, and has a lot of the mental and physical tools teams crave in a prospect. Mentally, the dude is a crazy competitor. Contagious work ethic, <a href="http://www.cw.ua.edu/article/2018/04/s-alabama-basketball-collin-sexton-impact-nba-draft">they had to force Sexton out of the gym at times</a>, which I think is one of the single most important qualities in a prospect. He’s cold-blooded, wants the ball in his hands at all times and especially in clutch situations. Plus, Avery Johnson calls a ton of plays, Good quick twitch athlete with lateral explosion and high end speed. Better vertical explosion than given credit for, won the McDonald’s Slam Dunk Contest. Offensively has a fantastic starting skillset. Good equity as a shot creator including surprisingly deep range on his jumper, can attack the rim, create for others, everything you could ask for. Supreme confidence in his jumper and can use his handle and quickness to get to his shots from anywhere in the floor, makes some mistakes with the ball but always looks to be confident. Has a pretty solid floater which he’ll need to continue to improve at. Jumper is mechanically sound, his transition from dribble to pull-up is super efficient and will continue to get stronger. Synergy rates him very highly in PnR ball handling/passing (top 10 percentile) which is his top skill in college. Has a nice stop and start ability to go along with that. Footwork on drives is great, is shifty and is good at snaking around guys on occasion or barrelling through them. Crazy high FTr, loves to attack bigger guys and draw fouls. Defense is solid, he plays engaged, quick feet, stays active, doesn’t make mistakes usually. 
<br><b>Negatives - </b>Doesn’t use his length as much as you’d expect. He’s good at a few things and projects well but other than his mentality isn’t great at anything. Shooting is solid but only around 34% from 3, not ideal. His unguarded catch-and-shoot numbers are bottom 20% on Synergy, which is a skill I would expect him to get better at if he’s playing off the ball more in the NBA. Speaking of, he really needs to improve as an off-ball player which isn’t a role he’s had to play before in his life. Driving ability is solid but decision-making lapses in terms of whether to shoot/pass, forces things. His passing ability is another major question mark, lowest APG numbers I’ve seen in a primary creator in a long time. I think that’s because although he’s capable of making simple reads he’s not a high level passer, nor is it his first instinct. If he sees someone open in front of him he can make the pass but can’t create for others like he can for himself. Some draft experts smarter than I am have <a href="https://twitter.com/polarfall/status/965796724194164736">questioned his handle</a>, saying he lacks smoothness and is inefficient. I’ll let others draw their own conclusions from that. Prefers his right hand, even on the left side of the rim. Can struggle sometimes finishing against length. Defensively tries to make the right play off-ball and works hard but sometimes reaches/over helps, IQ isn’t always there he is just competitive as hell but I don’t really know if that’s all that matters.  I’ve seen concerns that Sexton will not be a good player because teams would be committing so much to a player who has caps as an average player in that position, and having a median point guard isn’t an avenue towards team success. I can understand that take. According to net ratings, Alabama was (slightly) worse with him on the floor, mostly defensively. 
<br><b>Overall - </b>Every positive he has is basically offset by an equal negative, and that’s not something you want to see in a potential lottery guy. I understand guards are a dime a dozen in the NBA and you shouldn’t commit to just an average one, but his work ethic is so important to me. He’s a guy who wants to win more than anything, and his teammates love him. That’s something I value incredibly high.
<br><b>Comparison - </b>I don’t love the <span id="big_board" class="comp">Eric Bledsoe</span> comparison. I’m going to go out on a limb here and say I see <span id="big_board" class="comp">Goran Dragic/Jeff Teague</span> in his game, mixed with <span id="big_board" class="comp">Marcus Smart’s</span> tenacity.

<br>
<span id="big_board" class="tier_text">Tier 5 - relatively moderate chance @ average starter impact</span>
<br><br>
<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Landry Shamet, Wichita State - </span><br>
<b>Position - </b>On or off ball game, C&S shooter or PnR creator. Guards 1s&2s with high IQ.
<br><b>Positives - </b>Long 6’4 frame with long arms, good size for a “point guard.” Really skilled, cerebral player. Most of his offensive value comes from his shooting - 44% from 3, 82.5% from the line, and a 65.5% TS, one of the 3 highest in this class. Just a confident, consistent 3 point shooter who could shoot off the dribble just as easily as off the catch. Really nice footwork when catching, comes off the hop, clean, pointed toes at the rim. Also is efficient at shooting off jab steps and in sort of iso situations, just a very balanced shooter. Leverages his jumper with a phenomenal pump fake, gets guys in the air consistently, no wasted motion. With his shot comes a lot of pull-up 2s, shot 37.5% on 9.5% assisted, good but not great. Has a variety of step-backs and fades to get his points there. Relatively strong self-creator. Keeps a tight handle, relies on it to get to the basket where he shot 71.5% at the rim. He can be a true offensive point because he excels in PnR as well. His Synergy stats are insane, in the top percentile of running the PnR and the second percentile in guarded C&S, etc. Second to his shooting, his decision making is his best quality. He just makes very few mistakes with the ball. AST/TO% is almost 2.5, over 5 assists a game, always in control. Keeps his head on a swivel, just very, very good at reading and reacting. If he finds a mismatch he attacks it, swings the ball for open shots, locates shooters, everything you could want in a player. I love his off-ball movement, knows when to drift corner or float up, screen down, etc. Just feels the game on another level. That extends to defense, although on an unfortunately lesser scale. Still reads, reacts, rotates. Watches two guys. When guarding on an island does a good job of mirroring and staying with his guy, not the lightest feet but they get the job done. Length helps a lot too. Also a better athlete than he looks, has some vertical pop to him you don’t think about. 
<br><b>Negatives - </b>Could benefit from beefing up, made strides with arms but could use stronger chest and lower body. Can get knocked off his spots when driving and especially when defending. Struggles finishing inside against length, he shot well at the rim but half of those were assisted, which means that he converted mostly layups off passes. I think that’s important because it shows how lackluster he is at creating separation and getting to the rim. Also, liable to force the issue if his team can’t create offense. I doubt this would be a problem in the NBA but who knows. Low stock numbers is definitely cause for concern, I like his defense in a vacuum but he doesn’t really impact the game much. He can always be in the right spot, but if he doesn’t make plays and alter the offense’s gameplan, how much is that really worth?
<br><b>Overall - </b>There’s a lot to like with Shamet’s game. Combine his shooting with his IQ and you have a real NBA talent. He has an admittedly low ceiling but guys who just feel the game are guys that inevitably stick around longer than they should.
<br><b>Comparison - </b><span id="big_board" class="comp">Tomas Satoransky</span>
<br><br>
<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Chandler Hutchison, Boise State - </span><br>
<b>Position - </b>Clear modern 3 with ability to play small ball 4. 
<br><b>Positives - </b>6-foot-7 senior wing with a 7-foot-1 wingspan. Good athlete with a great first step. Solid scoring profile @ 20ppg, much improved shot-taker and maker. Had such an insane creation burden for Boise State, they relied on him for legitimately everything within their offense, USG% at 33.2. Upped his 3pt% to 36 and FT% to 72.5. It’s evident how much work has went into his mechanics, I really like how his body flows when shooting, one fluid motion. Gotten a lot better at catching off the hop in rhythm. Pretty good finisher around the basket - 72% at the rim on only 27.2% assisted, can finish with either hand. High FTr, averaged over 7 FTA/game. Nice footwork, loves to step through whether after a jump stop or sort of a euro. Long strider, really attacks the rim in the half court and puts emphasis on the defense, especially with the ball in transition. Draws a ton of his fouls that way. Relishes in attacking closeouts, very good at catching while moving to give himself forward momentum to attack. This package of attacking the basket is a real skill he has. Willing passer, every game I’ve seen of him he gets his teammates open looks and they just don’t convert, really good at hitting shooters on kickouts. Defensively is a mixed bag. Smart rotations, I’ve seen a few solid stunts and recovers, seeing one pass ahead. Rates well above average at Jackson Hoy’s defense rating in his draft database. Very strong work ethic <a href="https://www.si.com/nba/2017/12/13/nba-draft-chandler-hutchison-boise-state-weber-state-damian-lillard">as discussed in SI.</a> 
<br><b>Negatives - </b>Had the 4th best net rating on Boise State, not that I put much merit into those kinds of statistics. Lots of question marks regarding his shooting considering his senior season is the first in which he shot over 70% from the line. Needs to refine his midrange game, has some preliminary skills but it is by no means a weapon. Don’t have the Synergy numbers but seems like he lacks touch on his floaters. Not exactly a negative but he’s more of a drive-and-kick passer than a pick and roll one, whenever he gets a pick he never hits the roll man. Expanding off that, lackluster handle, very simple/linear, has no way to wow you with it, sort of limits his passing upside if he can’t leverage his drive and kick abilities. Turns the ball over a ton, barely positive AST/TO ratio, due in part to having such a creation burden for his team but also has a loose handle and gets it stripped while driving. Defensively seems a tiny bit slow IQ wise, liable to be out of position/not give effort. Usually it’s by the basket or on shooters because he just can’t risk fouling. That’s why it’s a mixed bag, are his lapses due to being so needed offensively or is he just an inconsistent defender?
<br><b>Overall - </b>Hutchison is a guy who is dependent on how his game would differ in an off ball role. If you think his efficiency would shoot up without such a high creation burden then he’s a first rounder. If you think for better or for worse he is who he is, then you’re not as high on him. I always bet on work ethic, and he seems to have it.
<br><b>Comparison - </b><span id="big_board" class="comp">Kyle Kuzma</span>
<br><br>
<span id="big_board" class="player_name">Jacob Evans, Cincinnati - </span><br>
<b>Position - </b>Prototypical 3&D wing with secondary PnR ability. Positive team defender used to switching.
<br><b>Positives - </b>Evans is a very consistent and even-keeled player. To start with his shot, he’s really become a consistently great shooter. 37% from 3 on 4.5 attempts per game, easily his best offensive skill. Good mechanics, no extraneous movement, well-balanced. Loves getting to his pull-up, one of the few guys who is just as good catch and shoot as he is off the dribble. High proclivity to shoot off movement, whether it be screen action or relocation. Has been playing a little point guard at 6’6 as evidenced by averaging 3.1 assists per game, most on the team. Doesn’t make too many mistakes, just makes the pass the defense gives him, 1.79 AST/TO ratio. Has some PnR upside too surprisingly, top 5 percentile as PnR ball handler. Averaged 2.3 stocks per game, makes an impact on the game on both ends. Very solid high IQ team defender, smart understanding of positionality and rotations and overall defensive concepts. Seems like he always knows whether to switch/hedge. Crisp rotations, 23 at rim blocks are a good baseline to show that he gets to the spots before the offense can. Strong upper body he uses to keep with bigger guys and also finish through contact. Has one of the highest 3nD and Defense ratings in Jackson Hoy’s database. Highest plus-minus, higher than advanced stat darling Gary Clark. 
<br><b>Negatives - </b>Seems like a pretty average athlete with a slightly below average frame. 6’6 with probably a similar wingspan but I can’t find it. Athletic ability is probably behind similar NBA 3nD wings. Also, he is a good shooter by eye test and by the stats but 75% from the line and 37% from 3 are not the splits of a deadeye marksman. 35% from midrange jumpers is equally uninspiring. I don’t love his shot fake. He doesn’t really like to attack closeouts. Doesn’t strike me as a great finisher inside, can’t fully blow by guys so he kind of settles for some tough righty floater often. Not a high-level passer, most of his assists are off simple ball movement or entry passes. His one on one defense is good, not great, probably the worst part of his defensive package. But in a vacuum it is above average, so not exactly a negative. I’ve had some questions about aggression, always looks very passive. Kawhi-esque. Just seems like he floats mentally and that he doesn’t want to be out there, I’m not saying that’s the case that’s just the appearance. 
<br><b>Overall - </b>In this class I’m unsure you can find a more ideal 3nD player. 6’6 athletes who can defend and shoot it don’t grow on trees and I think he’s the type of guy that every team could use. He takes almost nothing off the table, and you can easily imagine him in a few years playing meaningful minutes in a playoff game.
