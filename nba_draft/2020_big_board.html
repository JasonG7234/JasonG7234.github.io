<button class="accordion"><span id="big_board" class="player_name">?. Anthony Edwards, Georgia - </span></button><div class="old_panel"><p>Bulldog offensively, I am taking him first right now just because I think wings (even though he is probably a combo) impact the game more than bigs and guards, and I don't think Wiseman is good enough yet.</p></div>

<button class="accordion"><span id="big_board" class="player_name">?. James Wiseman, Memphis - </span></button><div class="old_panel"><p>Super smart kid, high IQ. Some flashes of a jump shot although really slow. Seems dependent on his left hand. Very similar to Marvin Bagley.</p></div>

<button class="accordion"><span id="big_board" class="player_name">?. Cole Anthony, UNC - </span></button><div class="old_panel"><p>Athletic point guard with good measurables. Shot 89% from the line and 38% in EYBL play. Plays downhill, settles for jump shots only as a last resort. Still think at this juncture I'd rather have Edwards & Wiseman.</p></div>

<button class="accordion"><span id="big_board" class="player_name">?. Theo Maledon, Villeurbanne - </span></button>
<button class="accordion"><span id="big_board" class="player_name">?. Deni Avdija, Maccabi Tel Aviv - </span></button>

<button class="accordion"><span id="big_board" class="player_name">?. Killian Hayes, Cholet - </span></button><div class="old_panel"><p>Poor shooter but good free throw percentage and mechanics. Shifty handle with some passing chops, reads the floor well. One of the younger players in this draft.</p></div>

<button class="accordion"><span id="big_board" class="player_name">?. Tre Jones, Duke - </span></button><div class="old_panel"><p>Love Tre a ton. I think he's the type of guy who impacts winning way more than his stats would show. He's a phenomenal individual defender and can run a team. Shooting isn't there yet but he has all the time and opportunity to improve, and he's got confidence in spades. He's not a star, but could fall late lottery in this class.</p></div>

<button class="accordion"><span id="big_board" class="player_name">?. RJ Hampton, New Zealand Breakers - </span></button><div class="old_panel"><p>One of the older freshman in the class, has a lot of raw talent and flashes a high level of fluidity but will need time to refine those skills and become the player he can be. Ultimately would like to see some improvement before thinking he's anything more than a raw athetic 6'9 big.</p></div>
<button class="accordion"><span id="big_board" class="player_name">?. Jaden McDaniels, Washington - </span></button><div class="old_panel"><p>One of the older freshman in the class, has a lot of raw talent and flashes a high level of fluidity but will need time to refine those skills and become the player he can be.
