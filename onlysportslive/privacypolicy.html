    <strong>Privacy Policy</strong> <p>
                  Jason Gomes built the OnlySports.Live Video Player extension as
                  a free extension. This SERVICE is provided by
                  Jason Gomes at no cost and is intended for use as
                  is.
                </p> <p>
                  This page is used to inform visitors regarding my
                  policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal
                  Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
                </p> <p>
                  If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to
                  the collection and use of information in relation to this
                  policy. 
                </p> <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p> <p>
                  I do not, nor do any of the libraries used in this extension, collect or store user data.
                  All usage of this app complies with these rules. I am not executing remote code. This is simply an extension that changes the current time of a video on onlysports.live.
                  I can't fathom why I need a privacy policy for this.
                  </p></div> <p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p> <p>
