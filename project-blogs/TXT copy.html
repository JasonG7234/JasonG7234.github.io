\f1\b\fs36 \cf3 How easy is it to predict sleepers in the NBA Draft using machine learning?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf3 November 9, 2020\
In case you couldn't tell by looking at this site, I really love basketball. \
I always was an NBA fan since the days of Jason Kidd and Allen Iverson. My dad is a New Jersey high school basketball scout, so he was more interested in watching the local guys play college basketball. \
Regardless, basketball was always on a TV at my house.\
Eventually, I felt like I had a good grasp on both college and NBA basketball, which led to me really loving the NBA Draft. I loved making mock drafts and guessing where each player was going, and then projecting how good the player would be in their situation.\
I was writing articles about the NBA Draft as far back as 2014 (although it seems like some of the images are no longer hosted on the server).\

\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0
\cf3 Once I got to college, my love for college basketball grew as I became a student manager for the Rutgers men's team. I got really invested in scouting and analytics.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs28 \cf3 I slowly grew into an NBA Draft guru.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf3 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0
\cf3 It all culminated my junior year, when I published my {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "file:///Users/jgomes/Projects/JasonG7234.github.io/nba_draft/2018_big_board.html"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 \strokec2 2018 NBA Draft Big Board}}. The final draft finished at just over 40 thousand words in total, covering 55 players.\
While I was going through the process of writing, I wanted some other way of evaluating prospects outside of the eye test. Sure, I could look up some advanced stats on each player, but that is just a piece of the puzzle.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs28 \cf3 I wanted to combine my programming expertise and my love of college basketball to create a model that would predict NBA careers based off of NCAA stats, starting with the 2020 NBA Draft.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf3 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0
\cf3 So, for step 1, I knew I needed to get a list of college prospects en masse. My thought was to go to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nbadraft.net/ranking/bigboard/"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 \strokec2 nbadraft.net}} and pull their Top 100 Big Board from every year they've released it (since 2009). Now, I understand a lot of draft pundits refute some of the rankings from this site, but I found it to be the most consistent and the easiest to scrape.\
After I whipped up a neat Python script using {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 \strokec2 BeautifulSoup}} to add all entries in all the Top 100 Big Board tables to a master CSV list, I used {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://pandas.pydata.org/"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 \strokec2 pandas}} to effectively organize/analyze it. After filtering out all the players who didn't play college basketball and adding RSCI ranks through {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://247sports.com/Season/2021-Basketball/CompositeRecruitRankings/?InstitutionGroup=HighSchool"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 \strokec2 247sports}}, I was left with ~1100 rows of prospect data.\
Step 2 is where things got needlessly hard. The idea was to head over to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 \strokec2 basketball-reference.com}} and pull each players' NCAA and NBA stats into the pandas DataFrame. However, there are a LOT of pain points I found with scraping basketball-reference.\

\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec3 basketball-reference would spell players' name inconsistently 
\f2\i on their own site
\f0\i0 . For example, basketball-reference had a college page for {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/maurice-harkless-1.html"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 \strokec2 Maurice Harkless}} but an NBA page for \cf2 \ul \ulc2 \strokec2 Moe Harkless\cf3 \ulnone \strokec3 .

This makes it harder to scrape and it makes the model less accurate, but I'll talk more to that point towards the end. \
\ls2\ilvl0\kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \outl0\strokewidth0 {\listtext	\uc0\u8226 	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec3 Common player names were really a nightmare. With names like {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/search/search.fcgi?search=Mike+Scott"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 \strokec2 Mike Scott}}, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/search/search.fcgi?search=Gary+Clark"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 \strokec2 Gary Clark}}, and even {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/search/search.fcgi?search=Anthony+Davis"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 \strokec2 Anthony Davis}}, it was difficult to ensure that I landed on the correct player page.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0
\cf3 All in all, these inconsistencies made me add ~175 lines of pure Python dictionaries just to map players to the correct pages.\
Once I figured out all these exceptions and started scraping the basketball-references pages successfully, I appended all of this data to the pandas DataFrame. Now with a ton of data, step 3 was to do some preliminary analysis using {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://matplotlib.org/"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 \strokec2 matplotlib}}. I wrote some extremely basic scatter plot functionality with two stats along the axes. Below, I graphed high school recruiting rankings by college win shares to see if there was any clear visual indication that higher recruits lead to more wins.\

\cf3 For Step 4, I actually get to the model. Now, just as a disclaimer, I learned everything I've known about machine learning through this project. I have never taken an ML class or done any other project in this field, so a lot of this was my best guess.\
In order to get the model ready, there's a lot I had to do to prep the data. \

\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec3 Most importantly, separate the X dataset into the train and test datasets.

\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0
\cf3 Now, onto the models. I started with a simplistic Logistic Regression model from {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scikit-learn.org/stable/"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 \strokec2 scikit-learn}}. I passed in two parameters to the constructor, one that changes the solver to 
\f3 liblinear
\f0  because that is apparently better for smaller datasets, and a higher number of iterations to (hopefully) make the model slightly more precise.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f3 \cf3 logreg = LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear', max_iter=500)
\f0 \
After fitting the training data to our 
\f3 liblinear
\f0  model, I were able to run the model and make some predictions. As you can see in the image below, the model hovered around 70% accuracy with 67% precision.\

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf3 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0
\cf3 Because the classification stuff for machine learning models can be a little complex, I'll try to explain what all these metrics mean. The coefficients at the very top of the picture are exactly what they sound: coefficients for each variable that lead to the results. That means for this version of the model, I positively correlated Win Shares/40 with a successful NBA career, and negatively correlated Free Throw Rate.\
To contextualize some of these numbers, 70.3% accuracy simply means that 70.3 of the predictions made by the model were correct. In the image below, I show the formula as (TP + TN) / Total. This is just True Positive predictions (players the model predicted to be in the NBA that actually were) + True Negative predictions (players the model correctly predicted weren't NBA players) divided by the total number of predictions made. Recall and Precision are described similarly in the picture.\

\cf3 Loss, to my best understanding from reading {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34518656/how-to-interpret-loss-and-accuracy-for-a-machine-learning-model"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 \strokec2 this stackoverflow answer}}, is just a summation of the errors made in the training set. I don't know what exactly defines an error, but I know that the goal is to reduce loss for the model.\
The confusion matrix is best described through the picture. Basically, it's just a simple visual classification of the results of the prediction.\
Okay, that's the explanation of the logistic regression model. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.tensorflow.org/overview/"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 \strokec2 Tensorflow}} is a more complex machine learning algorithm that defines and trains neural networks. A {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/neural-networks"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 \strokec2 neural network}} is basically a machine learning model that creates and utilizes nodes in a way similar to a brain's neurons. Because the tensorflow model is very different than the simpler regression model, I need to normalize the data in the way the model can understand it.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f3 \cf3 normed_x_train = normalize(x_train, x_train.describe().transpose())\uc0\u8232 normed_x_test = normalize(x_test, x_test.describe().transpose())
\f0 \
What the above code snippet does, to my best understanding, is make the data more meaningful. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.import.io/post/what-is-data-normalization-and-why-is-it-important/"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 \strokec2 Normalization}} gives the model context it wouldn't have otherwise. For example, the low/high-ends of True Shooting % of these prospects are 40% aand 80%, respectively. Whereas other stats like Offensive Rating, are between 80-120. It makes it extremely difficult for a good model to sensibly be able to understand the nuance with those numbers if you don't normalize the data to compare it to the standard deviation/mean.\

\f3 def normalize(val, stats):\uc0\u8232 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0val = (val - stats['mean']) / stats['std']\u8232 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0return val
\f0 \
The stats are now

\f0  parameter of "Adam" {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.dlology.com/blog/quick-notes-on-how-to-choose-optimizer-in-keras/"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 \strokec2 works well with little tuning of the parameters of the model}}. Finally, I add in the output metrics I care about.\

\cf3 After clarifying the model, I have to choose how many iterations the model will run for. If you recall, I ran the logistic regression model for 5000 iterations. With tensorflow, I choose 50 iterations. This is because if you run the tensorflow model for too many iterations, you risk over-fitting the model. This means that the model gets 
\f2\i more
\f0\i0  accurate on the training data, but 
\f2\i less
\f0\i0  accurate for its predictions on the test data.\
And now, to the prediction metrics.\

\cf3 Okay, the results are pretty clear to me... the tensorflow neural network model is 
\f2\i worse
\f0\i0  than the logistic regression model. There isn't a significant difference, but I'm surprised. I definitely screwed up somewhere along the way running the tensorflow model, so that's why I would imagine a simple logistic regression model is outperforming a neural network.\

\f1\b\fs28 \cf3 So, the metrics are clear. Now who specifically did the models like?\

\cf3 Overall, for reasons I will get to, the models 
\f2\i loved
\f0\i0  big men. The models gave some of the highest likelihoods of NBA success to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/stewais01.html"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 \strokec2 Isaiah Stewart}}, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/azubuud01.html"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 \strokec2 Udoka Azubuike}}, and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/t/toppiob01.html"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 \strokec2 Obi Toppin}}. These guys all have better odds of being NBA players, accoridng to the models, than consensus lottery picks {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/e/edwaran01.html"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 \strokec2 Anthony Edwards}} and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/halibty01.html"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 \strokec2 Tyrese Haliburton}}.\
The models, however, did do a good job at explicitly weeding out the players who weren't NBA caliber. NBADraft.net thought {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/steven-enoch-1.html"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 \strokec2 Steven Enoch}}, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/mustapha-heron-1.html"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 \strokec2 Mustapha Heron}}, and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/anton-watson-1.html"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 \strokec2 Anton Watson}} were NBA prospects, but the models definitely did not.\

<h3>Well your models didn\'92t perform that well. How can you improve them?</h3>\
<p>I\'92m glad you asked! There\'92s a <b>LOT</b> that can be improved. Here are three ideas I have been toying around with recently:\
<ol>\
<li>Equalize the playing field for different positions. Obviously,  there is some strange bias towards big men, and I think that is related to some of the stats I pass into the models. I thought I had stats that evened the positional playing field, but I guess I can be doing that better.</li>\
<li>Support more stats. Adding age and wingspan would definitely help contextualizing some prospect profiles.</li>\
<li>Increase sample size. Sadly, this isn\'92t something I can feasibly do, but adding more prospects will make the model more and more accurate.</li>\
</ol>\
<p>So that\'92s all I got. All the code I wrote can be found <a href="https://github.com/JasonG7234/NBA-Draft-Model\'94> if you want to dive in. There\'92s a lot of work I can do to improve this model, but I don\'92t think I will right now. I\'92m happy with all the knowledge I\'92ve gained.</p>\
<h3> I hope I lived up to my self-proclaimed billing on an NBA Draft guru. </h3>\
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>\
