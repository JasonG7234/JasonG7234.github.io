                    <p class="blog_post_meta">July 17, 2023</p>
                    <p>I moved out from my parents' house in October 2021. I remember renting a U-Haul truck, loading it up with the few pieces of furniture I had left over from college or taken from my grandpa's old house, and setting off for Tinton Falls. I found a nice, albeit small, apartment with a buddy I worked with and was ready to move out from home and spread my adult wings.</p>
                    <center><img class="blog-pic" src="../images/project-blogs/buying-a-house/uhaul.png" alt="The U-Haul boys"/></center><br /><figcaption>The U-Haul boys</figcaption><br />
                    <p>That apartment was good to me for basically two years. It was close to the beach, the rent was cheap, and it allowed me to grow on my own.</p>
                    <p>Recently, however, I realized I was ready for the next steps. I just got a <a href="job-hunt.html">new job</a> that was fully remote, so I had no ties to a specific location. I was tired of losing money to rent every month and wanted to move somewhere closer to my girlfriend near the city, my family, and my friends. But on top of that, I wanted to live somewhere <i>fun</i>. </p>
                    <p>Over a few weeks, I started putting together my house list:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Central location. I wanted to remain in Central NJ and be able to travel to NYC and the beach within 45 minutes max. I also wanted to remain close to my family and friends, so I didn't want to go to far north. I generally looked as south as Edison and as far north as Cranford.</li>
                        <li>A backyard. I didn't need anything too big, especially because it would just be me living there for now. But I like to be outdoors when I can, considering I sit and stare at a computer screen for 8+ hours a day. </li>
                        <li>Move-in ready. I'm not handy at all, so anything outside of the most minor of improvements is outside my ability.</li>
                        <li>Something within my budget.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <center><img class="blog-pic" src="../images/project-blogs/buying-a-house/centralnjarea.png" alt="Area I'm looking at"/></center><br /><figcaption>This is the general central NJ area I decided to live in.</figcaption><br />
                    <p>Just a quick disclaimer here - money/budget is obviously a pretty important part of the home-buying process. I don't want to dive too deep into the money aspect of things because it's a difficult conversation to have, and I realize I am incredibly fortunate to be in the position that I am to buy a house at 26. However, because financials are an important part of the story, I will tell it in the beginning to get it out of the way.</p>
                    <p>My max budget was $500K and my original down payment was $50K. After losing a few bids with similar offers but a lower down payment, I realized I needed to increase the down payment to $100K. I will go into in more detail later, but I got it at $430K with $100K down with just under 7% interest rate (which is incredibly high, and it's <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/fed-poised-hike-rates-markets-anticipate-inflation-endgame-2023-07-26/#:~:text=WASHINGTON%2C%20July%2026%20(Reuters),U.S.%20central%20bank's%202%25%20target.">gotten higher since</a>).</p>
                    <h2>House Hunting</h2><br />
                    <p>The most fun, and maybe the most stressful, part of buying a house is finding it. I knew my budget, the area I wanted to look, and exactly what I was looking for. I just needed to find a realtor.</p>
                    <h3>This happened to be the easiest part, and the best decision I could have made.</h3><br />
                    <p><a href="https://www.kw.com/agent/UPA-6587385289018081288-4">Eileen Dick</a> was a recommendation from my aunt and she was the best realtor I could have asked for. She lived in Metuchen so she really knew the area and had a lot of connections, and she was so vital for all of my many questions and requests. If you are looking to buy in central NJ, I can't recommend her enough.</p>
                    <p>After I gave her a call and talked through what I was looking for, we scheduled some time to tour Metuchen houses that week.</p>
                    <p>I'll never forget the first house I saw. It was <b>disgusting</b>.</p>
                    <center><img class="blog-pic" src="../images/project-blogs/buying-a-house/firsthouse.png" alt="The first house"/></center><br /><figcaption>When the Zillow listing shows no interior pictures and the house is listed "as is," it is NOT worth seeing.</figcaption><br />
                    <p>You could tell the house was lived in by a hoarder. There was crap EVERYWHERE, to the point where you could barely see the walls. There were so many dishes in the sink they looked like they could topple at any moment. I went out of my way not to take any pictures of it (which I completely regret in hindsight).</p>
                    <p>I'm not going to list every single one of the ~50 houses I've toured, but I'll highlight the more memorable ones and the offers I've placed:</p>

                    <p>The first offer(s) I placed, after a few weeks of searching, were <a href="https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/275-Rose-St-Metuchen-NJ-08840/39090355_zpid/">two of these townhouses in Metuchen</a>. They were both way below budget with hardwood floors & a basement, and had a little outdoor space to go with it. I ended up placing offers a little over asking price, but lost out on both.</p> 
                    <hr />
                    <center><img class="blog-pic" src="https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/89b01fb86377e5d93459e2ef07082dfd-cc_ft_1536.webp" alt="Metuchen fixer-upper"/></center><br /><figcaption>I came back around and talked myself into this fixer-upper.</figcaption><br />
                    <p>After the two townhouses, I came back to the second house I ever toured: <a href="https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/200-Columbia-Ave-Metuchen-NJ-08840/39088365_zpid/">this fixer-upper outside of downtown Metuchen</a>. It was a good size, had a beautiful screened-in porch, and was in a really great location. I looked past it the first time because it required a TON of work, but they dropped the price significantly after the sellers received no offers. I was thinking that if I could get it WAY below asking, I can put the money I saved towards some serious renovations.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, there happened to be another offer that came in slightly above mine around the same time. I could have gone higher but it would significantly bite into my budget for a place I wasn't crazy about. </p> 
                    <hr />
                    <center><img class="blog-pic" src="https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/8e6dc4e3e6cee6d41ad153c50c0d71b9-cc_ft_1536.webp" alt="Edison renovated house"/></center><br /><figcaption>I really loved this house in Edison.</figcaption><br />
                    <p>After searching for almost a month, I came across this <a href="https://www.zillow.com/homes/94-Crosby-Ave-Edison,-NJ-08817_rb/39066973_zpid/">this recently renovated house in Edison.</a>. It was GORGEOUS. The kitchen, bathroom, and living room were all brand new, there was a big backyard, AND there was a basketball court across the street! This was perfect for me!</p>
                    <center><img class="blog-pic" src="https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/03bb7ea1f18cf5583336f1d981fdbcd0-uncropped_scaled_within_1536_1152.webp"  alt="Edison renovated house kitchen"/></center><br /><figcaption>I don't cook much but I would become Gordon Ramsey in this kitchen.</figcaption><br />
                    <center><img class="blog-pic" src="https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/1ff01c801b9c4b857a83ae1f71713a8a-uncropped_scaled_within_1536_1152.webp"  alt="Edison renovated house basketball court"/></center><br /><figcaption>This basketball court is visible from the front window!</figcaption><br />
                    <p>I placed an offer after touring and was really hopeful. It was a little more expensive than I'd like, but it hit a lot of things on my wish list. Unfortunately, I lost another bidding war, and someone else got to watch basketball games from their front window.</p>

                    <p>After losing a few offers, I was really head over heels for this <a href="https://www.movoto.com/edison-nj/119-redwood-ave-edison-nj-08817-456_2117625r/">house in Edison</a>. It was well-decorated, it was a good size and a great price, and it had a pool!</p>
                    <center><img class="blog-pic" src="https://pi.movoto.com/p/456/2313967R_0_aQzzmJ_l.webp" alt="Edison poolhouse pool"/></center><br />
                    <p>I offered WAY over asking for this one. I really wanted it. It wasn't super close to Metuchen, but it was just an awesome house. I think there was some politics with this one, as the listing agent wasn't very communicative about the whole process. My read is that there was a buyer pre-chosen and the whole process was a formality, but I can never know for sure.</p>
                    <hr />
                    <h3>I was starting to lose hope.</h3><br />
                    <p>After over two months of searching, 26 houses toured, and 5 offers sent, I had NOTHING. No prospects, no potential houses. I even started looking at rentals in Metuchen, Hoboken, Red Bank, anywhere. I was losing faith.
                    <p>And then I found it.</p>
                    <p>Zillow notifications went off and found a beautiful duplex unit right across the street from the <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/nj-town-now-has-one-of-the-best-main-streets-in-america-after-incredible-turnaround/4194515/">award-winning Metuchen Main Street</a>. It was in a beautiful location, with a beautiful kitchen, a screened-in porch, a big basement, hardwood floors... it hit every single item on my list.</p>
                    <h3>I had to have it.</h3><br />
