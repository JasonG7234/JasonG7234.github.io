                    <p class="blog_post_meta">July 17, 2023</p>
                    <p>I moved out from my parents' house in October 2021. I remember renting a U-Haul truck, loading it up with the few pieces of furniture I had left over from college or taken from my grandpa's old house, and setting off for Tinton Falls. I found a nice, albeit small, apartment with a buddy I worked with and was ready to move out from home and spread my adult wings.</p>
                    <center><img class="blog-pic" src="../images/project-blogs/buying-a-house/uhaul.png" alt="The U-Haul boys"/></center><br /><figcaption>The U-Haul boys</figcaption><br />
                    <p>That apartment was good to me for basically two years. It was close to the beach, the rent was cheap, and it allowed me to grow on my own.</p>
                    <p>Recently, however, I realized I was ready for the next steps. I just got a <a href="job-hunt.html">new job</a> that was fully remote, so I had no ties to a specific location. I was tired of losing money to rent every month and wanted to move somewhere closer to my girlfriend near the city, my family, and my friends. But on top of that, I wanted to live somewhere <i>fun</i>. </p>
                    <p>Over a few weeks, I started putting together my house list:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Central location. I wanted to remain in Central NJ and be able to travel to NYC and the beach within 45 minutes max. I also wanted to remain close to my family and friends, so I didn't want to go to far north.</li>
                        <li>A backyard. I didn't need anything too big, especially because it would just be me living there for now. But I like to be outdoors when I can, considering I sit and stare at a computer screen for 8+ hours a day. </li>
                        <li>Something else</li>
                        <li>Something within my budget.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Just a quick disclaimer here - money/budget is obviously a pretty important part of the home-buying process. I don't want to dive too deep into the money aspect of things because it's a difficult conversation to have, and I realize I am incredibly fortunate to be in the position that I am to buy a house at 26. However, because financials are an important part of the story, I will tell it in the beginning to get it out of the way.</p>
                    <p>My max budget was $500K and my original down payment was $50K. After losing a few bids with similar offers but a lower down paymentMy original</p>
