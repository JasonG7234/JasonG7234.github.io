            <p class="blog_post_meta">March 13, 2021</p>
            <p>I've always wanted a really nice portfolio website. My friends in the industry always had these sweet, custom websites with Javascript particle effects and fancy CSS animations.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, I would always write inline CSS (it's so much easier to keep track of!), struggle with basic Javascript, and mess up semantic HTML.  </p>
            <p>I was initially turned off by making my own site. I had done some very simplistic HTML development in college classes, but I knew it was nothing in comparison to what my friends could do. I figured I just didn't need my own portfolio site.</p>
            <p>The one reason I changed my mind was honestly seeing my one friend who bought a domain. He went on <a href="https://namecheap.com">namecheap.com</a> and bought hisfullname.me for 9 dollars. </p>
            <p>He only spent $9 for a year with that domain.</p>
            <p><i>That</i> was the push I needed to start building my own site.</p>
            <h3>That night, I bought <a href="index.html">jasongomes.me</a> for $8.88.</h3><br>
            <p>Once school started to wind down, I scoured different sites, trying to find the perfect template and theme. I definitely did not want to use an existing template, but I also did not have the creativity/ability to design a site from scratch.</p>
            <p>I settled on emulating a friend's site with a simple, minimalistic style and a white background. I wish I could attach a screenshot of the site, but <a href="https://johnshammas.com">the site</a> has (reasonably) been updated since.</p>
            <p>I wish I could say I dove into website development with passion and vigor but that wouldn't be the case. I cobbled together a few pages, wrote some static web pages with in-line CSS, looked up some CSS properties, and called it a web site.</p>
            <p>Over a period of around 3 years, I added bits and pieces.</p>
            <p>I took a very simple Web Design class at Rutgers that taught me the basics of semantic HTML. During my junior year, I got really into the NBA Draft and had a friend help me with some Javascript to organize the content. After I finished and published the NBA Draft pages, I learned how to embed Google Analytics trackers in the pages.</p>
            <p>And finally, working at iCIMS showed me the importance of accessibility and mobile responsiveness.</p>
            <h2>So, this is my website right now.</h2><br>
            <p>I know it's not perfect. There's a LOT I still have to learn, and a lot of improvements I can make.</p>
            <p>But ultimately it's mine. It shows a lot of the progress I've made as a developer and I'm sure in a few years I'll make even more improvements and progress.</p>
            <p>At least now I have a site that I can show off to my friends.</p>
