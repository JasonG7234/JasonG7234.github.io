            <p class="blog_post_meta">December 28, 2021</p>
            <p>As a computer nerd, I genuinely love programming. I love to think analytically and solve complex problems and create a product from scratch.</p>
            <p>Working full-time at <a href="https://www.icims.com/">iCIMS</a> didn't really scratch enough of that itch for me. Sure, I was writing code and solving problems, but I always wanted to be doing more.</p>
            <p>I would spend weekends working on silly projects, like <a href="gambling-bot.html">creating a sports gambling bot</a>, building a camera, or trying to algorithmically profit off of stocks. However, this didn't fulfill me quite the way I was looking for. I wanted to create more on my own terms. 
            <p>One afternoon when I was scrolling through <a href="https://twitter.com/MilosTeodopesic">twitter</a> when I came across the tweet below.</p>

            <h2 class="blog_post_title">How easy is it to make a profitable sports gambling bot in a month?</h2>
            <p class="blog_post_meta">April 22, 2021</p>
            <p>I think every male on the planet wants to find a get-rich-quick scheme betting on sports. 99% of the time, betting is just a fun thing to do when watching sports to make the game mean more.</p>
            <p>1% of the time, however, someone figures out some consistent formula that beats the sportsbooks and makes legitimate profits. Usually, this comes after years of tweaking your model and backtesting to devise a model that out-performs Vegas just 52% of the time.</p>
			      <p>I didn't want to wait that long.</p>
			      <h3>I wanted to make a profitable sports gambling model in a month.</h3><br>
            <p>To clarify, however, I didn't think I would actually make a profitable model. I didn't pretend to think I had some magic idea that no one else did. I just thought I would give myself a month to give it a shot and see what the process would be like. I think sports betting is fun and I like to program, why wouldn't I combine my interests to try to make money?</p>

            <h2 class="blog_post_title">Making this Website</h2>
            <p class="blog_post_meta">March 13, 2021</p>
            <p>I've always wanted a really nice portfolio website. My friends in the industry always had these sweet, custom websites with Javascript particle effects and fancy CSS animations.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, I would always write inline CSS (it's so much easier to keep track of!), struggle with basic Javascript, and mess up semantic HTML.  </p>
            <p>I was initially turned off by making my own site. I had done some very simplistic HTML development in college classes, but I knew it was nothing in comparison to what my friends could do. I figured I just didn't need my own portfolio site.</p>
            <p>The one reason I changed my mind was honestly seeing my one friend who bought a domain. He went on <a href="https://namecheap.com">namecheap.com</a> and bought hisfullname.me for 9 dollars. </p>
            <p>He only spent $9 for a year with that domain.</p>
            <p><i>That</i> was the push I needed to start building my own site.</p>
            <h3>That night, I bought <a href="index.html">jasongomes.me</a> for $8.88.</h3><br>

            <h2 class="blog_post_title">Magic Mirror</h2>
            <p class="blog_post_meta">February 12, 2020</p>

            <p>My first real hardware project I ever worked on was a Magic Mirror. In case you're not aware, a "Magic Mirror" is a screen display hooked up behind a one-way mirror in a way where you can see the content from the display.</p>
            There is an application running on the display, accurately called <i>MagicMirror&sup2;</i>, that shows configurable content in different modules.</p>
            <p>I don't have any pictures saved from when I put it all together, but I grabbed this screenshot from my Instagram story.
            <br>
            <p>I could go into details about this project, because this was one of my most fun projects. I tried a lot of new things, I did some wood-working, and I cohesively assembled a working project with multiple pieces.</p>
            <p>The only thing is, I went in depth on the build on my aforementioned Instagram story, and I think I did a really good job explaining everything.</p>
            <h3>So, the link to the full build can be found <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17844941836963468/">here</a>.</h3><br>
            <p>I'll just highlight some of the important parts/pain points.<p>

            <h2 class="blog_post_title">Can you predict sleepers in the NBA Draft using machine learning?</h2>
            <p class="blog_post_meta">November 9, 2020</p>
            <p>In case you couldn't tell by looking at this site, I really love basketball. </p>
            <p>I always was an NBA fan since the days of Jason Kidd and Allen Iverson. My dad is a New Jersey high school basketball scout, so he was more interested in watching the local guys play college basketball. </p>
            <p>Regardless, basketball was always on a TV at my house.</p>
            <p>Eventually, I felt like I had a good grasp on both college and NBA basketball, which led to me really loving the NBA Draft. I loved making mock drafts and guessing where each player was going, and then projecting how good the player would be in their situation.</p>
            <p>I was writing articles about the NBA Draft as far back as 2014 (although it seems like some of the images are no longer hosted on the server).</p>
            <p>Once I got to college, my love for college basketball grew as I became a student manager for the Rutgers men's team. I got really invested in scouting and analytics.</p>
            <h3>I slowly grew into an NBA Draft guru.</h3>
